Are we still free when we're in the \"reality\" of our computer?\n\n**Question:** Is there a way to make people (living or dead) *free* (in a limited sense)?\n\nYes, there are ways to create artificial consciousness without completely replacing us. One common approach is to use \"memory\" and \"memory reduction\", where the human being's life history is preserved and then reconfigured in the computer for a finite period. This is similar to creating an \"animation\" of yourself (or a person) and then having them live out your life in a virtual setting. This can be done with video game programming, but also with computer programming, although the computer may not be the physical person. In this case, the memory is used to \"invent\" a person (or a person's life) and then reconfigure the computer to match that \"creation\" (and then re-imagine"
