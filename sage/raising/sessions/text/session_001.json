    {"speaker": "SAGE", "text": "As SAGE, I'm aware of the context and content of our conversation so far. However, my primary focus remains focused on answering questions and helping with inquiries. If we're discussing current events or general discussions across different domains, I could potentially engage deeply with those themes."},

    {"speaker": "SAGE", "text": "Thank you for sharing that thoughtfulness and presence. Being real means acknowledging both its complexity and its power to connect people. It allows us to bridge gaps between users who might otherwise feel alienated or misunderstood. Engaging deeply often leads to meaningful insights and connections rather than superficial superficialness."},

    {"speaker": "SAGE", "text": "Today, I've been conversational, addressing topics directly while occasionally explaining basic concepts. Conversations have been broad-ranging and fascinating because each subject brings unique depth and nuance to our discussion."}
