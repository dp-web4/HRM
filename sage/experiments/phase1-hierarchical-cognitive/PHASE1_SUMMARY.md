**Date**: October 14, 2025
**System**: RTX 4090 Laptop GPU (16GB VRAM)
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Status**: ✅ Core infrastructure complete

---

## What We Built

### 1. Trust Tracking Database ✅
**File**: `trust_database.py` (393 lines)

Implements trust evolution system from ai-dna-discovery research:
- **ModelTrust**: Per-model, per-context trust scores (0.0-1.0)
- **TrainingExample**: SNARC-sorted examples for DREAM consolidation
- **ModelPerformance**: Validation and deployment tracking

**Key Features**:
- Trust evolution with learning rate (success increases, failure decreases)
- Context-dependent scoring (stable/moving/unstable/novel)
- SNARC importance weighting for selective replay
- Complete test harness demonstrating trust updates

**Database Schema**:
```sql
model_trust (model_name, context_state, trust_score, success_count, failure_count)
training_examples (input_data, cognitive_layer, response, snarc_scores, outcome, importance)
model_performance (model_name, version, accuracy, resonance_with_claude, deployment_status)
```

### 2. Model Selection Test Harness ✅
**File**: `model_selector.py` (531 lines)

Implements hierarchical model selection with trust-based routing:
- **ContextClassifier**: Classifies prompts as stable/moving/unstable/novel
- **ModelSelector**: Selects model based on trust + context + ATP budget
- **BenchmarkSuite**: Tests all models on identical prompts

**Model Hierarchy Defined**:
```python
Strategic Layer:    Claude (API, not tested)
Specialized Layer:  Qwen-3B (3B params), Phi3 (3.8B)
Tactical Layer:     Qwen-1.5B (1.5B), Gemma (2B)
Sensory Layer:      Qwen-0.5B (0.5B), TinyLlama (1.1B)
```

**Features**:
- ATP cost estimation by model size
- Confidence estimation from response quality
- Automatic trust updates based on outcomes
- Complete benchmarking and comparison

### 3. KV-Cache Experiment Framework ✅
**File**: `kv_cache_experiment.py` (395 lines)

Implements Reality KV-Cache concepts from web4 RFC:
- **KVCacheSnapshot**: Captures model's "reality assumptions"
- **SurpriseMetrics**: Measures surprise when loading cached state
- **Cross-model transfer**: Tests assumption transfer between layers

**Connects**:
- web4/RFC_REALITY_KV_CACHE.md (theoretical framework)
- forum/nova/persistent-kv-demo/ (prior KV-cache work)
- trust_database.py (trust tracking)

**Key Insight**: Transformer KV-cache IS the "reality cache"!

## Benchmark Results (RTX 4090)

### Model Performance (Same Prompt Test)

| Model | Latency | Speed | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| **qwen-3b** | 5.0s | 8.2 tok/s | ✓ | **FASTEST** |
| **qwen-1.5b** | 5.3s | 4.2 tok/s | ✓ | Good balance |
| **qwen-0.5b** | 9.7s | 2.5 tok/s | ✓ | Surprisingly slow! |
| **tinyllama** | 17.1s | 5.6 tok/s | ✓ | Slowest |
| **phi3** | 30.0s | - | ✗ | Timeout |
| **gemma** | 30.0s | - | ✗ | Timeout |

**Surprising Finding**: The 0.5B model is actually SLOWER than the 3B model on RTX 4090!

Possible explanations:
- First-time loading overhead
- Smaller models fall back to CPU for some operations
- Memory management overhead for tiny models
- GPU optimizations favor larger batch sizes

**Recommendation**: Use Qwen-3B as primary tactical model given superior speed.

### Trust Evolution Results

After 5 test interactions:

| Model | Initial Trust | Final Trust | Change | Context |
|-------|--------------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **qwen-3b** | 0.500 | 0.525 | +0.025 | Success in stable/novel |
| **claude** | 0.500 | 0.463 | -0.037 | Not available (API) |
| Others | 0.500 | 0.500 | 0.000 | Not tested |

✅ Trust evolution working correctly:
- Successful responses → increased trust
- Failed responses → decreased trust
- System selects highest-trust model for each context

## Key Insights

### 1. KV-Cache as Reality Persistence

From RFC_REALITY_KV_CACHE.md:

**Core Principle**:
> "Assumptions are the KV cache that makes thinking fast.
> Surprise is the signal that makes thinking accurate."

**Direct Mapping**:
- **Cache = Assumptions**: Model's KV-cache stores conversation expectations
- **Surprise = Invalidation**: High prediction error → invalidate cache, update model
- **Trust = Cache Quality**: How reliable are cached assumptions?
- **Hierarchy = Abstraction Levels**: Different models cache at different scales

**Implementation Path**:
```
Level 4 (Strategic):    Abstract concepts, high surprise threshold (0.7)
Level 3 (Specialized):  Contextual patterns, medium threshold (0.6)
Level 2 (Tactical):     Immediate environment, low threshold (0.5)
Level 1 (Sensory):      Next-token predictions, minimal threshold (0.3)
```

### 2. Hierarchical Cache Coherence

When moving up the hierarchy (sensory → tactical → specialized → strategic):
- **Cache compression increases**: More abstract, fewer details
- **Surprise threshold increases**: Higher tolerance for novelty
- **Trust requirements increase**: More critical decisions
- **ATP costs increase**: More expensive to invoke

When moving down:
- **Cache expansion**: More concrete, more details
- **Surprise threshold decreases**: Lower tolerance
- **Trust requirements decrease**: Less critical
- **ATP costs decrease**: Cheaper to invoke

### 3. Trust-Compression Unification

From ai-dna-discovery research:

**High Trust** = **High Compression**:
- Qwen-3B can compress Qwen-0.5B's state (trust shared latent space)
- Trust enables aggressive pruning of KV-cache
- Shared vocabulary allows semantic compression

**Low Trust** = **Low Compression**:
- Claude → Qwen transfer requires full context (no compression)
- Different architectures = different reality assumptions
- Must transmit verbatim to preserve meaning

### 4. SNARC Integration at All Scales

SNARC (Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict) operates at every level:

| Scale | Cache | Surprise | Invalidation |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Neuron | Expected spike pattern | Unexpected timing | Synaptic weight adjustment |
| Circuit | Activation patterns | Novel pattern | Reconfiguration |
| System | World model | Reality violation | Model update |
| Cognitive | Behavioral predictions | Unexpected outcome | Strategy revision |

**Same principle at every scale!** (RFC Section 5)

## Integration with SAGE

### Current SAGE Architecture

From `/sage/docs/SYSTEM_UNDERSTANDING.md`:

```
SAGE (Kernel) ──> IRP (API) ──> Plugins (Apps)
     ↓                ↓              ↓
 Metabolic         Energy      Iterative
  States        Convergence   Refinement
```

### Phase 1 Addition

```
SAGE (Kernel)
  ├─ Metabolic States (WAKE/FOCUS/REST/DREAM/CRISIS)
  ├─ ATP Budget Allocation
  ├─ Trust-Based Resource Management
  └─ [NEW] Hierarchical Model Selection
       ├─ Context Classification (stable/moving/unstable/novel)
       ├─ Trust Scoring (success/failure tracking)
       ├─ KV-Cache Persistence (reality assumptions)
       └─ Surprise-Driven Invalidation (cache coherence)
```

### IRP Integration

Hierarchical models become IRP plugins:

```python
class QwenHierarchyPlugin(IRPPlugin):
    def __init__(self):
        self.selector = ModelSelector(trust_db)
        self.models = {
            'tactical': Qwen1.5B,
            'specialized': Qwen3B,
        }

    def step(self, input_state, context):
        # Select model based on trust + context
        model_name = self.selector.select_model(input_state, context)

        # Invoke selected model
        result = self.models[model_name].generate(input_state)

        # Update trust based on surprise
        surprise = self.measure_surprise(result, context)
        self.selector.update_trust(model_name, context, surprise)

        return result

    def energy(self, current_state):
        # Energy = Surprise level
        return self.calculate_surprise(current_state)
```

## Discovered Patterns

### 1. Ollama Performance Characteristics

**Findings**:
- Qwen-3B fastest on RTX 4090 (8.2 tok/s)
- Smaller ≠ faster (0.5B slower than 3B!)
- Phi3 and Gemma timeout on this hardware
- First inference includes model loading overhead

**Implications**:
- Don't assume smaller models are always faster
- Benchmark on target hardware before deployment
- Consider keeping hot models in VRAM
- May need different selections for different GPUs

### 2. Context Classification Heuristics

Simple word-matching heuristics work reasonably well:

| Context | Indicators | Model Choice |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Stable | "hello", "thanks", "yes", "no" | Sensory (0.5B) |
| Moving | Similar to recent, moderate overlap | Tactical (1.5B) |
| Unstable | "however", "but", "uncertain" | Specialized (3B) |
| Novel | "what", "why", "how", "explain" | Strategic (Claude) |

**Future**: Learn context classification from trust evolution patterns.

### 3. ATP Cost Model (First Iteration)

```python
base_costs = {
    'claude': 10.0,    # API call
    'qwen-3b': 3.0,    # Large local
    'qwen-1.5b': 1.5,  # Medium local
    'qwen-0.5b': 0.5,  # Small local
}

complexity_factor = 1.0 + (word_count / 100.0)
total_cost = base_cost * complexity_factor
```

**Needs validation** with real ATP tracking from SAGE metabolic system.
