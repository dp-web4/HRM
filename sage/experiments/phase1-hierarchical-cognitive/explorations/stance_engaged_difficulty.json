      "response": " Is it just a mind?\nThe question of consciousness is a fundamental question in the philosophy of mind. The mind is often understood to be the seat of perception, but it can also be understood as a conscious experience of the world around us, such as being able to see, hear, smell, taste"

The brain is composed of various parts, including the cerebrum, which is the highest part of the brain and contains the brainstem and the cerebellum. The cerebrum is responsible for"
