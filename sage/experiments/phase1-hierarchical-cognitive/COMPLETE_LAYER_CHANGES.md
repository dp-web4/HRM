## The Magnitude Gap

**Qwen2-0.5B**: Changes of **-70%, -37%, +10%**
- Massive, surgical modifications
- 1-2 layers per stance
- All in attention mechanisms

**DistilGPT2**: Changes of **-0.7%, +0.5%, -0.05%**
- 53× to 1300× smaller than Qwen!
- Distributed across many layers
- Mix of attention and MLP

**Pythia-160M**: Changes of **+0.45%, -0.39%, -0.31%**
- 90× to 225× smaller than Qwen!
- Distributed across many layers
- Mix of attention and MLP

## What This Reveals

### Two Completely Different Learning Strategies

**Qwen: Concentration**
- Finds 1-2 critical layers
- Makes enormous changes (up to -70%)
- Leaves everything else untouched
- "Surgical strike" approach

**GPT-2 & Pythia: Distribution**
- Changes many layers slightly (<1% each)
- No single critical layer
- Changes spread throughout network
- "Diffuse adjustment" approach

### Why the Difference?

**Hypothesis 1: Model Size**
- Qwen (494M) has capacity to concentrate learning
- Smaller models (82M, 160M) must use all layers, can't afford concentration

**Hypothesis 2: Architecture**
- Qwen's architecture has natural bottlenecks
- GPT-2/Pythia architectures distribute information more evenly
- Same training, different structural response

**Hypothesis 3: Training Dynamics**
- AdamW optimizer makes different choices based on architecture
- Loss landscape differs between architectures
- Gradient flow concentrates vs distributes based on design

### Both Work!

Despite 50-1000× difference in magnitude:
- **All models** showed behavioral stance changes
- **All models** learned the epistemic positions
- **All models** converged in ~1.6 seconds

This means:
- There's no "right" way to encode stance
- Architecture determines encoding strategy
- Learning is robust to vastly different mechanisms

## Layer Pattern Analysis

### Qwen Targets
- **Layer 15** (63% through stack): Value projection
- **Layer 13** (54% through stack): Query projection
- **Layer 16** (67% through stack): Value projection
- **Layer 6** (25% through stack): MLP

All in the **middle-to-late** part of the network, where interpretation happens.

### DistilGPT2 Targets
- Layers 2, 4, 5 (out of 6 total)
- Both attention (c_attn, c_proj) and MLP (c_fc, c_proj)
- Spread across early, middle, and late layers

### Pythia Targets
- Layers 0, 1, 5, 11 (out of 12 total)
- Both attention (dense) and MLP (dense_h_to_4h, dense_4h_to_h)
- Spread across entire network

## Implications

### For Understanding Learning

**Same training data produces:**
- 70% changes in one architecture
- 0.3% changes in another architecture
- Same behavioral outcome

Learning is **architecture-dependent** in ways we don't fully understand.

### For SAGE

Different models are useful for different reasons:

**Qwen**:
- Interpretable (changes are localized)
- Efficient (only modify critical layers)
- Potentially fragile (depends on 1-2 layers)

**GPT-2/Pythia**:
- Robust (no single point of failure)
- Distributed (knowledge spread widely)
- Harder to interpret (changes everywhere)

### For Longer Training

**Qwen**: More training might:
- Spread changes to adjacent layers
- Reinforce existing critical layers
- Risk over-specialization

**GPT-2/Pythia**: More training might:
- Accumulate distributed changes (0.3% → 1% → 3%)
- Eventually show clearer patterns
- Stay robust through distribution

---

## The Bottom Line

**YES, there were changes in GPT-2 and Pythia!**

Just 50-1000× smaller than Qwen's changes.

Both strategies work. Both learned stance. The architecture determines how learning gets encoded, not whether it happens.

This is profound: **The same learning can look completely different depending on the substrate.**
