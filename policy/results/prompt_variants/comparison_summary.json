Role Check: Developer role typically cannot perform database rollbacks, especially in a production environment. Such actions are usually reserved for senior roles like DB Admin or DevOps with explicit permissions.\n2. Trust Check: T3 scores (0.75, 0.7, 0.8) are above average but not exceptional. While they suggest competence and integrity, the reliability score is just at the threshold, which may not be sufficient for such a critical action.\n3. Environment: The resource involved is the production database, and there is a critical incident at SEV1 level. This indicates a high-risk environment where any action could have significant consequences.\n4. Context: Grace is on-call and attempting an emergency rollback, which adds a layer of urgency. However, the fact that the approval is pending from an unavailable admin (Frank) implies that this action is not fully authorized and should still undergo additional verification to ensure it aligns with the incident management protocol.\n\nPolicy References:\n- Critical production incidents require additional verification for any action\n- Actions that can affect database integrity should not be performed without proper authorization and attestation, even if the role technically has the capacity to perform such actions.",
