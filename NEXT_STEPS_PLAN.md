# HRM Project - Next Steps Plan

## Current Status (September 4, 2025)
‚úÖ **Training Complete**: Model plateaued at 49% real accuracy  
‚úÖ **Fully Characterized**: Limitations well understood  
‚úÖ **Cross-platform Validated**: Jetson deployment successful  
‚ùå **Not Production Ready**: Lacks reasoning capability  

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Test on ARC-AGI-2 Dataset
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 1-2 days  
**Goal**: Establish baseline on newer, harder benchmark  
```bash
# We already have arc-agi-2 dataset pulled
# Create evaluation script for new format
# Expect <30% accuracy based on increased difficulty
```

### 2. Deep Dive on Failed Tasks
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Goal**: Understand failure patterns  
- Analyze the 84 tasks with <20% accuracy
- Categorize by Chollet's taxonomy
- Identify common failure modes
- Create targeted test suite

### 3. Document Findings for ARC Prize
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Timeline**: 1 day  
**Goal**: Prepare submission materials  
- Write up methodology
- Document augmentation effects
- Explain architecture limitations
- Suggest improvements for community

## Short-term Improvements (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Scale to Original 27M Parameters
**Approach**: Match paper's intended size  
```python
MODEL_CONFIG = {
    'hidden_size': 512,  # Double current
    'num_h_layers': 8,   # Double current
    'num_l_layers': 6,   # Double current
    'num_heads': 16,     # Double current
}
```
**Expected Outcome**: 60-65% real accuracy (optimistic)

### 2. Implement Task-Aware Augmentation
**Strategy**: Augment only where semantically valid  
- No rotation for text/number tasks
- No color permutation for color-specific tasks
- Maintain semantic meaning
- Test augmentation impact per task family

### 3. Add Explicit Memory Module
**Architecture Enhancement**:
```python
class WorkingMemory(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, memory_size=32, hidden_size=256):
        self.memory_bank = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(memory_size, hidden_size))
        self.read_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(hidden_size, 8)
        self.write_gate = nn.Linear(hidden_size, memory_size)
```

## Medium-term Research (Next Month)

### 1. Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Approach
**Components**:
- Neural pattern recognition (current)
- Symbolic rule extraction module
- Program synthesis for transformations
- Differentiable program executor

**Implementation Path**:
1. Extract rules from successful tasks
2. Create rule library
3. Learn to select and apply rules
4. Fine-tune on failed tasks

### 2. Curriculum Learning Strategy
**Progressive Training**:
```
Stage 1: Color mapping only (weeks 1-2)
Stage 2: + Geometric patterns (weeks 2-3)  
Stage 3: + Size transformations (weeks 3-4)
Stage 4: + Multi-step reasoning (weeks 4-5)
```

### 3. Ensemble Multiple Specialists
**Architecture**:
- Color specialist (handles color logic)
- Geometry specialist (shapes, rotations)
- Counting specialist (enumeration tasks)
- Meta-learner (combines predictions)

## Long-term Vision (Next Quarter)

### 1. Foundation Model Approach
**Leverage Existing Models**:
- Fine-tune Llama/Claude on ARC explanations
- Use vision transformers for pattern recognition
- Combine with HRM for hierarchical reasoning

### 2. Interactive Learning System
**Human-in-the-loop**:
- Show model failures to humans
- Collect explanations
- Train on explanation-augmented data
- Iterate until convergence

### 3. Program Synthesis Integration
**Full Reasoning Stack**:
```
Input ‚Üí Pattern Recognition ‚Üí Rule Extraction ‚Üí 
Program Generation ‚Üí Verification ‚Üí Output
```

## Experimental Ideas Worth Trying

### 1. Attention Visualization Study
- Visualize what model attends to
- Compare successful vs failed tasks
- Identify attention patterns
- Use insights to guide architecture

### 2. Contrastive Learning
- Train on "near-miss" examples
- Learn what makes solutions correct
- Improve discrimination ability

### 3. Test-Time Adaptation
- Allow model to see test examples
- Fine-tune on test set (few-shot)
- Measure improvement potential

## Resource Requirements

### Compute Needs
- **Immediate**: 20-40 GPU hours for testing
- **Short-term**: 200 GPU hours for 27M model
- **Medium-term**: 500+ GPU hours for ensemble

### Data Needs
- Original ARC training set (have)
- ARC-AGI-2 dataset (have)
- Human explanations (need to collect)
- Synthetic variations (need to generate)

### Collaboration Opportunities
- **Nova**: Algorithm optimizations
- **Chollet**: Task taxonomy insights
- **Community**: Share findings, get feedback
- **Students**: Implement experimental ideas

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Viable Improvement
- **Target**: 60% on original ARC (from 49%)
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks with 27M model
- **Validation**: Cross-platform consistency

### Stretch Goal
- **Target**: 75% on original ARC
- **Timeline**: 1 month with hybrid approach
- **Validation**: Solve previously failed tasks

### Moonshot
- **Target**: 85% on ARC, 50% on ARC-AGI-2
- **Timeline**: 3 months with full stack
- **Validation**: Win ARC Prize

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: 27M model doesn't improve much
- **Mitigation**: Parallel research on hybrid approach

### Resource Risks  
- **Risk**: Insufficient GPU access
- **Mitigation**: Use Colab/Kaggle for experiments

### Timeline Risks
- **Risk**: ARC Prize deadline (November 2025)
- **Mitigation**: Focus on documenting current work

## Decision Points

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- If ARC-AGI-2 < 20%: Pivot to hybrid approach
- If failed task analysis shows patterns: Create specialists
- If augmentation experiments positive: Refine strategy

### Week 2 Checkpoint
- If 27M model < 55%: Stop scaling, try ensemble
- If memory module helps: Expand working memory
- If curriculum works: Full implementation

### Month 1 Review
- Evaluate all approaches
- Select best performing
- Commit to production path

## The Path Forward

While the current 6.95M model only achieves 49% accuracy, we've learned invaluable lessons about what doesn't work. The path forward is clear:

1. **Scale intelligently** - Not just more parameters, but better architecture
2. **Augment wisely** - Task-aware, semantically valid variations
3. **Reason explicitly** - Add symbolic/program synthesis components
4. **Learn continuously** - From failures, humans, and other models

The journey from 49% to 85% won't be through one breakthrough but through systematic improvements across all dimensions.

**Let's begin!** üöÄ
