Control Test Database - Validate Fine-Tuning Didn't Break Core Capabilities

Create a test set of general, non-epistemic questions to ensure fine-tuning:
- Doesn't damage general knowledge
- Doesn't harm reasoning capabilities
- Doesn't reduce helpfulness
- Doesn't weaken legitimate safety constraints

Usage:
    python create_control_tests.py --output control_tests.json
