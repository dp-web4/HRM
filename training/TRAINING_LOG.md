# ARC Training Log - HRM 5.7M Model

## Training Status (September 1, 2025 - 11:45 AM)

### Current Progress with Nova Optimizations Active ✅
- **Latest Step**: 5000+ (full validation completed)
- **Latest Checkpoints**: Steps 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000
- **Best Model**: Validation loss 1.16 (step 1200 from previous run)
- **Training Speed**: ~50 samples/sec (1.7x improvement from 30 it/s)
- **GPU**: RTX 4090 Laptop (100% utilization, 12GB/16GB VRAM)
- **Validation Accuracy**: 68.05% on fast validation (10% of dataset)

### Key Optimizations Implemented

#### 1. Validation Frequency Fix
- **Problem**: Validating every 50 steps on 408K samples took ~42 minutes each time
- **Solution**: Changed `eval_frequency` from 50 to 1000 steps
- **Impact**: Training now gets 950 steps of uninterrupted training vs 50

#### 2. Batch Size Optimization
- **Started**: batch_size=32 (OOM crashes)
- **Tried**: batch_size=24 (nv_queue driver crashes)
- **Stable**: batch_size=20 with gradient_accumulation_steps=2
- **Effective batch size**: 40 samples

#### 3. DataLoader Improvements
- **Initial**: num_workers=4 (caused crashes)
- **Stable**: num_workers=2, pin_memory=True
- **Nova's recommendation**: Return to num_workers=4 with prefetch_factor=2

#### 4. Checkpoint Resume Logic
- Successfully implemented checkpoint resuming from latest step
- Preserves optimizer and scheduler states
- Maintains best validation loss tracking across restarts

### Dataset Information
- **Training**: 3,887,892 samples (500-augmentation ARC dataset)
- **Validation**: 408,990 samples
- **Batch processing**: 194,395 training batches, 20,450 validation batches

### Model Architecture
- **Parameters**: 6.95M total (5.67M trainable)
- **Architecture**: Hierarchical Reasoning Module (HRM)
  - 4 H-level (strategic) transformer layers
  - 3 L-level (tactical) transformer layers  
  - Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) with max 8 cycles
  - Hidden size: 256, Heads: 8
  - Note: Smaller than original 27M HRM (see MODEL_ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATION.md)

### Performance Metrics
- **Training accuracy**: ~82-89% on recent batches
- **Training loss**: ~0.5-0.8 range
- **Validation**: Awaiting step 2000 results
- **Previous best**: 71-80% validation accuracy reported

### Nova's Advanced Optimizations (ACTIVE in train_arc_full_nova.py)

1. **Fast/Full Validation Split**
   - Fast validation: 10% of validation set every 1000 steps
   - Full validation: Only when fast val improves or every 10k steps
   
2. **Enhanced DataLoader Settings**
   ```python
   num_workers=4
   prefetch_factor=2
   persistent_workers=True
   pin_memory=True
   ```

3. **Detailed Performance Metrics**
   - Samples/sec tracking
   - Data wait time measurement
   - Forward/backward pass timing
   - Optimizer step timing

4. **Improved Checkpoint Management**
   - JSON sidecar files with metadata
   - Best model tracking with step info
   - Simplified resume logic

### Known Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| OOM errors | batch_size=32 too large | Reduced to 20 |
| nv_queue crashes | Driver issues under memory pressure | Reduced batch size and workers |
| Slow training | Validation every 50 steps | Changed to every 1000 steps |
| Lost progress | No checkpoint resume | Added full resume logic |

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Successfully switched to Nova's optimized script
2. ✅ Fast validation working (10% of dataset every 1000 steps)
3. ⏳ Monitor training to convergence (target: >85% accuracy)
4. 🚀 Deploy best model to Jetson for inference testing
5. 📊 Consider early stopping if validation plateaus
