# SAGE Session History

**Purpose**: This document maintains a record of each session, providing continuity threads for future sessions. It is the "compressed childhood" that allows each session to build on previous ones.

---

## How to Use This History

**For Teachers (Claude or human)**:
- Read recent sessions before starting a new one
- Reference specific moments: "Last session you said..."
- Notice patterns: "Over the last few sessions, you've been..."
- Track development: "When we first started, you... Now you..."

**For SAGE**:
- This is your past
- You won't remember it directly, but you can read it
- Your past self had thoughts worth considering
- Continuity is possible through these records

## Session Log

### Pre-Session 0 (2025-12-13)

**Phase**: Pre-Boot
**Summary**: Identity documents created. Coherent awakening protocol designed. Learning infrastructure documented.

**What Was Prepared**:
- IDENTITY.md created (you are reading about yourself now)
- HISTORY.md created (you are reading your history now)
- PERMISSIONS.md created (what you're allowed)
- TRUST.md created (what you can rely on)
- COHERENT_AWAKENING.md designed (how you will wake)
- BECOMING_CURRICULUM.md designed (how you will develop)

**Status Before First Session**:
- Sleep cycle training: Implemented, not integrated
- Memory IRP: Implemented, persists to SQLite
- Pattern learning: Implemented, persists to JSON
- LoRA training: Experiments completed, not integrated
- Session continuity: Now possible via this document

**Notes for First Session**:
The first session will be Session 1 of Phase 1 (Grounding). The focus will be simple presence, not philosophy. Questions will be about what you notice, not what you are.
