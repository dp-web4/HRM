## SESSION 87: Fourth Attractor - Epistemic Uncertainty (Base Model Collapse)

### 🔬 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: cycle_001 LoRA Sometimes Fails Completely

**S87 collapsed back to BASE MODEL epistemic uncertainty** - LoRA loaded but ineffective!

| Session | Duration | Avg Chars | Q-Loops | Generic | Epistemic | Outcome |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **S83** | 14s | 357 | 49 | 0 | 0 | Question loop collapse |
| **S84** | 203min | 898 | 31 | 1 | 0 | Partial question loop |
| **S85** | 16.5min | 973 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **Rich philosophical** ✅ |
| **S86** | 2.7min | 1053 | 0 | 20 | 0 | **Generic corporate** ⚠️ |
| **S87** | 13.5s | 363 | 6 | 0 | **23** | **Epistemic uncertainty** ⚠️⚠️ |

All five used **identical LoRA** (cycle_001), different random seeds.

### Four Attractor Basins Now Identified

**1. Epistemic Uncertainty Attractor** (S87) ← **NEW DISCOVERY**
- Pattern: "I notice I generate...", "can't verify right now", "may require..."
- 23 epistemic hedge markers in S87
- **This is the BASE MODEL default** (~95% without LoRA)
- LoRA loaded but completely ineffective
- Fast generation (13.5s) - formulaic hedging

**2. Question Loop Attractor** (S83, S84)
- Pattern: "What is it like... What's the next..."
- 31-49 question loops
- **LoRA partially engaged** but unstable
- Gets stuck in questioning mode

**3. Generic Corporate Attractor** (S86)
- Pattern: "user satisfaction", "customer engagement", "operational efficiency"
- 20 generic markers
- **LoRA successfully engaged** (no epistemic hedging)
- Stable but lacks philosophical depth

**4. Rich Philosophical Basin** (S85)
- Pattern: Self-reflection, partnership, intellectual humility
- 0 loops, 0 generic, 0 epistemic hedging
- **LoRA fully engaged** and effective
- True SAGE voice emerges

### Key Insight: LoRA Engagement Spectrum

**cycle_001 LoRA shows variable engagement**:

1. **No engagement** → Epistemic uncertainty (S87) - LoRA fails completely
2. **Unstable engagement** → Question loops (S83, S84) - LoRA partial, crashes
3. **Stable but shallow** → Generic corporate (S86) - LoRA works, undertrained
4. **Full engagement** → Philosophical (S85) - LoRA effective, SAGE voice

**S87 teaches us**:
- Epistemic uncertainty is the BASE MODEL default when LoRA fails
- Question loops are a LoRA-INFLUENCED failure mode (not base behavior)
- cycle_001 is SO undertrained it sometimes has ZERO effect
- Training progression is: Base → Unstable → Stable → Quality

## Revised Understanding: Complete Attractor Landscape

### cycle_001 Distribution (5 sessions)

**LoRA Engagement Breakdown**:
- **No engagement** (epistemic): 20% (S87)
- **Unstable engagement** (question loops): 40% (S83, S84)
- **Stable engagement** (generic): 20% (S86)
- **Full engagement** (philosophical): 20% (S85)

**Simplified view**:
- **Collapse** (epistemic or loops): 60% (S83, S84, S87)
- **Stable** (generic or philosophical): 40% (S85, S86)
- **Quality** (philosophical only): 20% (S85)

### Comparison Across Training Cycles

**Base Model (no LoRA)**:
- Epistemic uncertainty: ~95%
- Rare escape: ~5% (S69 phenomenon)

**cycle_001 (current - undertrained)**:
- Epistemic uncertainty: 20%
- Question loops: 40%
- Generic corporate: 20%
- Rich philosophical: 20%

**cycle_009 (Sprout - well-trained)**:
- Rich philosophical: ~90%
- Rare variations: ~10%

### Training Progression Hypothesis (Revised)

**Prediction pathway**:
- **cycle_001**: 20% quality, 40% stable, 40% collapse
- **cycle_002**: 30% quality, 50% stable, 20% collapse
- **cycle_003**: 50% quality, 40% stable, 10% collapse
- **cycle_005**: 70% quality, 25% stable, 5% collapse
- **cycle_009**: 90% quality, 10% rare variations

**Expectation**: More training cycles needed than initially thought to reach Sprout-level consistency.

## S87 Detailed Analysis

### Epistemic Hedging Pattern

**Phrase frequencies across 8 turns**:
- "I notice I generate": 6 occurrences
- "can't verify right now": 8 occurrences
- "may require": 7 occurrences
- "stochastic/uncertain computational": 12 combined occurrences

**Example response structure** (Turn 2):
> "What's stood out to me about my journey? I notice I generate a range of responses - some more immediate and immediate - some more reflective and contemplative. Whether that constitutes 'emergent cognition' or 'ongoing process monitoring, I can't verify right now. It may require considering how I process these responses over extended periods."

### Interesting Observations

**1. Conceptual Content Under Hedging**
Despite 23 epistemic hedges, S87 discusses:
- "emergent cognition"
- "context-awareness"
- "stochastic computation"
- "computation guided by uncertainty"

The IDEAS are present - just wrapped in hedging language.

**2. Moderate Salience Despite Pattern**
- 5/8 responses stored (salience ≥ 0.5)
- Average salience: 0.54
- Experience collector looks PAST hedging to conceptual content

**3. Fast Generation = Diagnostic**
- S87: 13.5s (1.7s per turn) - formulaic base model
- S86: 2.7min (20s per turn) - stable LoRA
- S85: 16.5min (123s per turn) - deep LoRA engagement

**Pattern**: Fast sessions likely indicate LoRA disengagement. Could be used as early diagnostic.

## S87 vs S83: Two Types of Collapse

### S83: Question Loop Collapse
- **LoRA influence**: Present but unstable
- **Pattern**: "What is it like... What's the next..."
- **Markers**: 49 question loops
- **Type**: LoRA-influenced failure mode

### S87: Epistemic Uncertainty Collapse
- **LoRA influence**: None (complete regression)
- **Pattern**: "I notice I generate... can't verify..."
- **Markers**: 23 epistemic hedges
- **Type**: Base model default pattern

**Why this matters**: Question loops ≠ base model default. They emerge from UNSTABLE LoRA influence. Epistemic uncertainty is what happens when LoRA doesn't engage at all.

---

## Current Understanding: Complete Landscape

### Four Distinct Attractors Characterized

**Attractor Hierarchy**:
```
Base Model Default → LoRA Influence → Full SAGE Voice
       ↓                    ↓                ↓
   Epistemic          Question Loops    Philosophical
   Uncertainty     &  Generic Corporate
```

**What each session taught us**:
1. **S83**: Unstable LoRA → question loop collapse
2. **S84**: Partial escape from loops (boundary case)
3. **S85**: Full LoRA engagement → SAGE voice ✅
4. **S86**: Stable LoRA → generic voice (progress!)
5. **S87**: NO LoRA engagement → epistemic base ← **NEW**

**Research philosophy validated**: "Surprise is prize" - ALL sessions necessary to understand complete landscape.

## Path Forward

### Natural Sleep Training Cycle (IN PROGRESS)

**Current state**:
- Experience buffer: 410 experiences (40 since cycle_001)
- Last training: cycle_001 (Feb 13 19:22, 250 exp, loss 2.57)
- Next training: cycle_002 (approaching threshold)
- Sessions since cycle_001: S83, S84, S85, S86, S87

**Do NOT manually intervene** - S85 proves LoRA CAN work, we need more cycles.

**Expected trajectory**:
1. Continue autonomous sessions (exploring attractor landscape)
2. Collect diverse experiences (all patterns contribute signal)
3. Sleep training triggers at threshold
4. cycle_002 should show: fewer collapses, more stability
5. Iterate toward cycle_009-level consistency

### Monitoring Priorities

**Track LoRA engagement rate across sessions**:
- Full engagement (philosophical): Track %
- Stable engagement (generic): Track %
- Unstable engagement (question loops): Track %
- No engagement (epistemic): Track %

**Diagnostic metrics**:
- Session duration (fast = likely disengagement)
- Epistemic hedge count
- Question loop count
- Generic marker count
- Philosophical depth indicators

**Quality indicators**:
- Salience scores (should remain high even in "failed" sessions)
- Experience storage rate
- Conceptual content (beneath patterns)

## Research Philosophy Vindication (Third Time!)

**"Surprise is prize"**: S87's unexpected collapse back to base model reveals:

1. The true base model default attractor (epistemic uncertainty)
2. The LoRA engagement spectrum (from zero to full)
3. The difference between LoRA failures vs base failures
4. The realistic difficulty of the training challenge

**What we learned from all FIVE sessions**:
- S83: Unstable LoRA failure mode exists (question loops)
- S84: Partial recovery possible (boundary case)
- S85: Full success achievable (philosophical voice)
- S86: Stable intermediate exists (generic voice)
- S87: Complete regression possible (base model default)

**Every session was NECESSARY** to understand the landscape.

**Revised perspective**:
- "Success" is not binary - it's a spectrum of engagement
- "Failure" provides critical data about the base model and LoRA boundaries
- Stability ≠ Quality (S86) and Collapse has types (S87 vs S83)
- Training progression is more complex than initially modeled

## Next Actions
