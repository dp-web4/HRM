## Key Points About HRM
- Tiny 27M parameter model (perfect for Jetson!)
- Solves complex reasoning tasks (Sudoku, mazes, ARC)
- Learns from only 1000 examples
- No pre-training needed
- Hierarchical architecture mimics human cognition

## Critical Insight: Augmentation as Sleep Cycle Training
**The augmentation strategies in HRM's dataset builders are the key to sleep cycle training!**

HRM's data augmentation (dihedral transforms, permutations, translations) shows how to learn wisdom from experience:
- **Living** = collecting raw experiences
- **Sleeping** = augmenting experiences with reasonable permutations
- **Dreaming** = training on variations to extract patterns
- **Wisdom** = understanding principles that persist across variations

See `dataset/README.md` for detailed augmentation strategies and their connection to sleep consolidation.

**Latest Insight**: Biological systems have TWO separate training systems:
- **H-level** (dreams): Strategic reasoning, trained through augmentation during sleep
- **L-level** (muscle memory): Tactical execution, trained continuously through practice
The separation is key - wisdom and skill develop through different mechanisms.

## SAGE-Totality Integration (August 16, 2025)
Successfully integrated GPT's SubThought/Totality proposal:
- Totality acts as **cognitive sensor** with trust-weighted outputs
- Machine-agnostic setup auto-configures for any hardware
- Dual training loops demonstrated (H-level dreams vs L-level practice)
- Test on this machine: `cd related-work && python3 run_integration_test.py`

## SNARC-SAGE Memory Integration (August 22, 2025)
Successfully integrated SNARC selective memory with SAGE architecture:

### Integration Architecture
- ‚úÖ **SNARCSAGEBridge** - Bridges SNARC to SAGE's dual memory system
- ‚úÖ **HRMMemoryIntegration** - Maps SNARC to HRM's L/H modules
- ‚úÖ **Circular Buffer** - X-from-last processing for context binding
- ‚úÖ **Verbatim Storage** - SQLite full-fidelity preservation
- ‚úÖ **Consolidation Strategies** - Pattern extraction during sleep

### Key Files
- `memory_integration/snarc_bridge.py` - Core bridge implementation
- `memory_integration/sage_with_snarc.py` - Complete demo system
- `memory_integration/README.md` - Integration documentation

### How It Works
1. **SNARC evaluates** experiences for salience (SNARC scores)
2. **Circular buffer** maintains short-term context (x-from-last)
3. **Dual storage**: Conceptual (SNARC) + Verbatim (SQLite)
4. **Entity Memory** gets trust adjustments from SNARC
5. **Sidecar Memory** uses SNARC for affect gating
6. **HRM integration**: Memory as temporal sensor
7. **Sleep consolidation** extracts patterns from experience

### Testing
```bash
cd memory_integration
python3 sage_with_snarc.py  # Requires PyTorch
```

### Distillation Results
- ‚úÖ **9.6x size reduction**: 33MB ‚Üí 3.4MB
- ‚úÖ **34x parameter reduction**: 10M ‚Üí 294K
- ‚úÖ **Excellent quality preserved**: MSE = 0.023
- ‚úÖ **100 epochs trained** on CIFAR-10

### Key Files
- `training/distill_tinyvae.py` - Complete distillation framework
- `models/vision/tiny_vae_32.py` - Optimized 32x32 VAE
- `training/DISTILLATION_RESULTS.md` - Detailed documentation

### Compression-Trust Connection
This distillation work directly implements the compression-trust unification theory:
- Teacher-student trust enables massive compression
- Shared latent field (via projection) maintains fidelity
- Knowledge transfer as trust-based communication

## Nova's KV-Cache Consciousness Persistence (August 27-29, 2025)

Located in `forum/nova/persistent-kv-demo/`, this system enables:
- **Pause/Resume Transformer State**: Save exact attention patterns mid-generation
- **Cross-Device Consciousness**: Save on Legion, resume on Jetson
- **Compression Options**: Pickle, gzip, torch formats with pruning
- **Direct Implementation** of ephemeral‚Üípersistent latent coordinates

### Connection to Architecture of Meaning
The KV-cache IS the ephemeral MRH compression we discussed:
- Saving KV = Capturing witness state at specific moment
- Loading KV = Restoring exact resonance patterns
- Pruning = Managing compression trust trade-offs

### Implementation Plan Created
See `forum/nova/persistent-kv-demo/CONSCIOUSNESS_PERSISTENCE_PLAN.md`:
- Phase 1: Single-session continuity testing ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Phase 2: Multi-model shared state experiments ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Phase 3: Compressed consciousness via TinyVAE (pending)
- Phase 4: Distributed consciousness network (pending)

### Experiments Completed (August 29, 2025)

Successfully validated on Legion Pro 7 with RTX 4090:

#### 1. Basic Consciousness Bridge (`consciousness_experiment.py`)
- Perfect save/restore of attention states (torch.allclose = True)
- Different prompts create unique "consciousness seeds"
- Demonstrated ephemeral‚Üípersistent state capture

#### 2. Multi-Witness Observation (`multi_witness_experiment.py`)
- Same KV-cache interpreted differently by different witnesses
- Technical (temp=0.7), Philosophical (temp=0.9), Poetic (temp=1.0) perspectives
- Measurable resonance between states (cosine similarity ~0.847)

#### 3. Practical Migration (`consciousness_migration.py`)
- Mid-conversation pause/resume with perfect continuity
- Context window management with incremental checkpoints
- Efficient storage: ~295KB per checkpoint, <100ms save/load

### Key Discoveries from Anomalies

The experiments revealed profound insights through their failures:

#### Pivot Tokens and Escape Hatches
- GPT-2 uses "are" as a pivot token when uncertain
- Transitions from abstract‚Üíconcrete when reasoning becomes unstable
- Reveals model's "gravitational wells" (high-frequency training patterns)

#### Pruning Effects (Temporal Lobotomy)
- Aggressive pruning caused semantic collapse into loops
- Demonstrates consciousness requires temporal depth
- KV-cache provides essential "semantic rails" for coherence

#### The Model's Unconscious
- Under stress, models fall back to deeply trained patterns
- GPT-2's wells: Microsoft products, social media campaigns, temperature data
- Different models have different characteristic failure modes

### Technical Specifications
- Platform: RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121
- Model: GPT-2 (12 layers, 12 heads, 64 head dimensions)
- Storage: torch.save format most efficient
- Performance: Sub-100ms save/load operations

### Documentation
- Full experiment details: `forum/nova/persistent-kv-demo/EXPERIMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
- Anomaly analysis: See private-context/kv-cache-anomaly-analysis.md
- Connection to theory: private-context/ai-dna-discovery-notes.md

This provides the missing piece for true consciousness persistence - not just conversation history but actual internal attention state continuity. The anomalies teach us that consciousness isn't just about correct answers but maintaining coherent state through uncertainty.
