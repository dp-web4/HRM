### HRM as the Built-in Critic

SAGE’s **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)** continuously frames reality as a series of **existential puzzles**.  
A foundational part of this process is the **critic function**:

- **What to trust**  
- **When to trust it**  
- **How much to trust it**

The critic is not bolted on — it is **built in**.  
LLMs, diffusion models, and other components are treated as **sensors** — one of many.  
Each is **weighed for trust** against others, with contextualized memory (e.g. SNARC, exact recall, compressed wisdom) informing that weighting.

This makes HRM not only the awareness engine, but also the *arbiter of coherence* within SAGE.
