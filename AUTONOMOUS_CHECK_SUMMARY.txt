KEY ISSUE FOUND & FIXED:
=========================

Track 3 Test Import Error (CRITICAL BUG):
- Location: sage/cognition/test_integration.py
- Problem: Incorrect relative imports causing ImportError
- Impact: Track 3 validation tests were failing
- Fix: Changed to absolute imports (sage.cognition.*)
- Result: All 7 integration tests now passing ✓

Before (broken):
```python
from attention import AttentionManager, ResourceBudget
from working_memory import WorkingMemory, PlanStep
from deliberation import DeliberationEngine, Alternative
from goal_manager import GoalManager, Goal
```

After (fixed):
```python
from sage.cognition.attention import AttentionManager, ResourceBudget
from sage.cognition.working_memory import WorkingMemory, PlanStep
from sage.cognition.deliberation import DeliberationEngine, Alternative
from sage.cognition.goal_manager import GoalManager, Goal
```

TRACK 3 VALIDATION:
===================

Re-validated SAGE SNARC Cognition:
✅ test_scenario_1_basic_navigation PASSED

✅ test_scenario_4_hierarchical_goals PASSED
✅ test_scenario_5_attention_resource_limits PASSED
✅ test_scenario_6_working_memory_capacity PASSED
✅ test_scenario_7_full_cognitive_cycle PASSED

Runtime: 3.55s (no performance regression)

- System health: Excellent, 102+ hours uptime
- No critical issues found

AUTONOMOUS DECISION:
====================

Decision: Bug fix complete, system healthy, await user action

Rationale:
1. Critical Track 3 bug found and fixed
2. All validation tests passing
3. Track 4 Phase 1 ready for Nano deployment (user hardware needed)
4. No other issues or builds to check
5. System stable with 4+ days uptime

Actions Taken:
✅ Fixed Track 3 test imports (critical bug)
✅ Validated all 7 cognition tests passing
✅ Cleaned up stale PID files
✅ Updated documentation
✅ Committed changes (8cdd3ae)
✅ Verified clean working tree

Next Steps (Awaiting User):
- Track 4 Phase 2: Deploy to Jetson Nano
- Test CSI camera on actual hardware
- Validate performance targets
- Record metrics and commit results

COMPARISON TO SESSION #25:
==========================

Session #25 (Track 4 Phase 1):
- Implemented vision sensor (540 lines)
- Created deployment documentation
- 3 git commits (Track 4 implementation)
- Result: Phase 1 complete, ready for Nano

Session #26 (Maintenance):
- Found and fixed Track 3 bug
- Validated all tests passing
- Cleaned up stale files
- 1 git commit (bug fix)
- Result: System healthy, tests operational

Progress: Both sessions productive, maintaining code quality

RESEARCH CONTEXT:
=================

SAGE Consciousness Project:
- Target: Jetson Nano deployment
- Architecture: SNARC cognition + multi-sensor integration
- Status: Core cognition complete, vision ready for hardware

User Guidance (from NANO_HARDWARE_ANSWERS.md):
- Camera: CSI (not USB)
- Test environment: Jetson Nano (not desktop)
- Pattern: Find existing → Extend → Test on hardware

Pattern Established:
Session #23: Architecture design ✓
Session #24: Monitoring ✓
Session #25: Implementation ✓
Session #26: Maintenance ✓
Next: Nano deployment (user action required)

FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION:
============================

1. sage/cognition/test_integration.py (import fix)
2. thor_worklog.txt (session findings)
3. AUTONOMOUS_CHECK_SUMMARY.txt (this file)

Stale files removed:
- sage/examples/*.pid (3 files)

Git Commit: 8cdd3ae (bug fix + validation)

NEXT SESSION EXPECTATIONS:
==========================

If user deploys to Nano:
- Track 4 Phase 2 will begin
- CSI camera testing
- Performance validation
- Metrics collection

If no deployment:
- Continue monitoring
- Check for any new user commits
- Maintain system health
- Wait for next autonomous check or user action
