# SAGE Implementation Plan

*Date: September 5, 2025*  
*Project: SAGE - Sentient Agentic Generative Engine*  
*Objective: Build attention orchestration system with 100M parameters*

## Executive Summary

SAGE is an attention orchestration engine that decides what deserves focus, when to employ language reasoning, and how to coordinate resources. It's not trying to be the intelligence itself - it orchestrates multiple specialized intelligences through attention management.

## Core Architecture (100M Parameters)

### Parameter Distribution
- **H-Module (Strategic)**: ~45M parameters
  - 7 transformer layers for deep strategic reasoning
  - Layers 1-2: Context encoding/translation
  - Layers 3-5: Core strategic cognition
  - Layers 6-7: Strategy preparation/communication
  
- **L-Module (Tactical)**: ~45M parameters  
  - 7 transformer layers for tactical execution
  - Layers 1-2: Input processing/translation
  - Layers 3-5: Core tactical reasoning
  - Layers 6-7: Action generation/output
  
- **Interaction/Context**: ~10M parameters
  - Bidirectional H↔L communication layers
  - Context fusion networks
  - Resource routing heads
  - SNARC scoring networks

### Why 100M Parameters?
- **Critical mass for emergence**: Below this, no true reasoning emerges
- **Still efficient**: 1/5th of tiny 0.5B LLMs
- **Edge-deployable**: Fits on Jetson Orin Nano
- **Proven threshold**: Literature shows reasoning emergence at ~100M

## Philosophy Note

SAGE represents a fundamental shift in how we think about AI systems. Instead of trying to build one model that does everything, we're building an attention engine that knows when to call upon specialized resources. This mirrors how biological intelligence works - we don't process everything equally, we attend to what matters and recruit appropriate cognitive resources as needed.

The 100M parameter threshold isn't arbitrary - it's the minimum complexity needed for emergent reasoning. Below this, we get pattern matching. Above this, we get understanding. SAGE sits at this critical threshold, lean enough for edge deployment yet complex enough for true intelligence.
