# Real GR00T Implementation Plan for SAGE

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What We Have
1. **Real NVIDIA GR00T N1.5** at `/home/dp/ai-workspace/isaac-gr00t/`
2. **Eagle 2.5 VLM** model files (configs, processors, tokenizers)
3. **Demo Data**: 5 pick-and-place episodes with videos and parquet files
4. **Complete Pipeline**: Training, inference, and deployment scripts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found
1. Model initialization expects pre-loaded weights
2. Eagle layers list is empty (needs model download)
3. Action head requires proper config initialization

## Implementation Strategy

Since we discovered we have the REAL GR00T (not mock), we should:
1. **Use GR00T as Teacher** for knowledge distillation into SAGE
2. **Extract Vision Features** using Eagle 2.5 for camera input
3. **Learn Action Policies** from GR00T's demonstrations

## Phase 1: Setup and Verification

### Step 1.1: Install GR00T Package
```bash
cd /home/dp/ai-workspace/isaac-gr00t
pip install -e .
pip install pandas pyarrow  # For reading demo data
```

### Step 1.2: Download Model Weights (Optional - Large)
```bash
# This is 3B parameters - might be too large for RTX 2060
huggingface-cli download nvidia/GR00T-N1.5-3B --local-dir ./models/
```

### Step 1.3: Alternative - Use Eagle Vision Only
Instead of full GR00T, we can use just the Eagle vision encoder which is smaller and more manageable.

## Phase 2: Vision IRP Implementation

### Step 2.1: Create Lightweight Vision Encoder
```python
class LightweightVisionIRP(IRPPlugin):
    """Vision IRP using available models"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Option A: Use CLIP or similar lightweight model
        from transformers import CLIPModel, CLIPProcessor
        self.model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
        self.processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
        
        # Option B: Use TinyVAE we already built
        from models.vision.tiny_vae_32 import TinyVAE32
        self.vae = TinyVAE32()
    
    def process_image(self, image):
        # Extract visual features
        inputs = self.processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
        features = self.model.get_image_features(**inputs)
        return features
```

### Step 2.2: Process Demo Data
```python
class DemoDataProcessor:
    """Process GR00T demo data for SAGE training"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_path = Path("/home/dp/ai-workspace/isaac-gr00t/demo_data")
    
    def load_episode(self, episode_idx):
        # Load parquet file
        df = pd.read_parquet(f"episode_{episode_idx:06d}.parquet")
        
        # Extract states and actions
        states = df['observation.state'].values
        actions = df['action'].values
        
        # Load corresponding video
        video_path = f"episode_{episode_idx:06d}.mp4"
        
        return states, actions, video_path
```

## Phase 3: Knowledge Distillation Architecture

### Step 3.1: Teacher-Student Setup
```python
class GR00TToSAGEDistillation:
    """Distill GR00T knowledge into SAGE"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Teacher: Use GR00T demo data as ground truth
        self.demo_processor = DemoDataProcessor()
        
        # Student: SAGE with vision IRP
        self.sage = SAGE(config)
        self.vision_irp = LightweightVisionIRP()
    
    def distill_episode(self, episode_idx):
        # Load demonstration
        states, actions, video = self.demo_processor.load_episode(episode_idx)
        
        # Process through vision IRP
        vision_features = self.vision_irp.process_video(video)
        
        # SAGE learns to predict actions
        predicted_actions = self.sage.predict_actions(vision_features, states)
        
        # Distillation loss
        loss = mse_loss(predicted_actions, actions)
        return loss
```

### Step 3.2: Trust-Attention Loop
```python
class TrustAttentionSurprise:
    """Implement trust-attention-surprise loop"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.trust_scores = {}  # Object -> trust score
        self.attention_weights = None
        self.surprise_threshold = 0.5
    
    def update(self, observation, prediction, actual):
        # Measure surprise
        surprise = torch.abs(prediction - actual).mean()
        
        # Update trust based on surprise
        if surprise > self.surprise_threshold:
            # Reduce trust in current attention
            self.reduce_trust()
        else:
            # Increase trust
            self.increase_trust()
        
        # Recompute attention based on trust
        self.attention_weights = self.compute_attention(self.trust_scores)
```

## Phase 4: Integration Pipeline

### Step 4.1: Complete System
```python
class SAGEWithRealVision:
    """SAGE with real vision processing"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Core components
        self.vision_irp = LightweightVisionIRP()
        self.sage_core = SAGE(config)
        self.trust_loop = TrustAttentionSurprise()
        
        # Metabolic states
        self.metabolic_state = MetabolicState.WAKE
        
    def process_observation(self, image, state):
        # Vision processing
        vision_features = self.vision_irp.process_image(image)
        
        # Trust-weighted attention
        attended_features = self.trust_loop.apply_attention(vision_features)
        
        # SAGE reasoning based on metabolic state
        if self.metabolic_state == MetabolicState.WAKE:
            action = self.sage_core.reason_wake(attended_features, state)
        elif self.metabolic_state == MetabolicState.DREAM:
            action = self.sage_core.consolidate_dream(attended_features)
        
        return action
```

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

### Step 5.1: Test on Demo Data
```python
def test_on_demos():
    system = SAGEWithRealVision()
    
    for episode in range(5):  # 5 demo episodes available
        states, actions, video = load_episode(episode)
        
        # Process each frame
        for frame, state, true_action in zip(video, states, actions):
            predicted_action = system.process_observation(frame, state)
            
            # Measure performance
            error = mse(predicted_action, true_action)
            print(f"Episode {episode}, Error: {error:.4f}")
```

## Resource Optimization

Given RTX 2060 SUPER limitations (8GB VRAM):

1. **Use Smaller Models**:
   - CLIP instead of Eagle 2.5 (if Eagle too large)
   - TinyVAE for compression
   - Quantized models where possible

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process video frames in small batches
   - Use gradient accumulation for training

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Clear cache frequently
   - Use mixed precision (fp16)
   - Offload to CPU when needed

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Discovered real GR00T model location
2. üîÑ Create lightweight vision IRP (current task)
3. ‚è≥ Load and process demo episodes
4. ‚è≥ Implement trust-attention loop
5. ‚è≥ Test on pick-and-place task

## Alternative Approaches

If full GR00T is too resource-intensive:

### Option A: Vision-Only Pipeline
- Use only Eagle vision encoder
- Skip action head, create custom policy
- Focus on visual understanding

### Option B: Compressed Models
- Use our TinyVAE for vision
- Distill Eagle features into smaller model
- Maintain quality through careful distillation

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Use GR00T for offline distillation
- Deploy lighter SAGE model for inference
- Periodic retraining with GR00T teacher

## Conclusion

We have discovered the REAL GR00T model, which changes our approach from simulation to actual knowledge distillation. The key insight is to use GR00T as a teacher model rather than trying to run it directly on our hardware. This aligns perfectly with our original goal of distilling knowledge into SAGE.
