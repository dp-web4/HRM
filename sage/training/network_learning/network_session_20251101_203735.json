Some people, like those who are eating a vegetarian diet, can lose weight without any exercise by changing their diet. The article also suggests that if you want to lose weight, you can go on a diet and work out for a few weeks, then you can stop.\n\nThis method is great for people who want to lose weight but don\u2019t like to exercise, like those who are vegetarians or vegans, because they need to go on a diet first.

The prompt is designed to test the user's understanding of basic number theory concepts and basic algorithm design.\n\n2. The function should be named `is_prime`, and it should take one argument, which is the number to be checked.\n\n3. If the number is less than or equal to 1, the function should return `False` since 1 is not a prime number.\n4. If the number is 2 or 3, the function should return `True` since both 2 and 3 are prime numbers.\n5. If the number is any other number, the function should return `False` since these numbers are not prime.\n\n6. To ensure the function works for all valid input, we use the following approach:\n\n- If the number is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False` by default.\n- If the number is 2 or 3, the function returns `True` as 2 and 3 are prime.\n- If the number is any other number, the function returns `False` as these numbers are not prime.\n\n7. The solution to this problem is to create a function called `is_prime` that takes one argument, the number to be checked. Inside the function, we handle the base cases where the number is less than or equal to 1 and 2",
