      "response": "Sure! Making tea involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Gather ingredients (tea bags, loose leaves, boiling water), prepare your environment for brewing, and choose your favorite method.\n\n2. **Pouring Water**: Use a teapot if using steeped tea, or pour hot water directly into the pot on the stove or in an electric kettle. Fill the pot halfway to avoid overflowing.\n\n3. **Brew Time**: For single-serve infusions like green, black, or white tea, steep about 3-4 minutes depending on desired strength. For more complex teas, use longer steep times (around 1 minute per bag). For herbal teas, steep just until dissolved.\n\n4. **Heat Tea**: Boil water over medium heat (about 150°C) while steeping the tea. Avoid opening the lid too quickly; this could release steam, causing the water to spill out.\n\n5. **Serving**: Pour hot water slowly over the tea leaves",

However, since I'm focused on tea preparations rather than weather-specific cooking instructions, the most practical approach is to focus on gathering relevant historical weather data or general tea brewing tips from reputable resources.",
