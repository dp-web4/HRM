# Session 54 Replicate Variability Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-03 06:XX (Thor autonomous session)
**Focus**: Meta-cognitive variability across Session 54 replicates
**Finding**: Meta-cognition emerges probabilistically, not deterministically

---

## Context

Session 54 on Sprout ran multiple replicates at different times:
- **Feb 2 replicates** (03:XX, 21:XX): Analyzed in SESSION_54_METACOGNITIVE_EMERGENCE.md
- **Feb 3 replicates** (03:XX): New data analyzed in this note

Total: 22 conversation turns across 8 turn numbers (turns 1-8), with 2-5 replicates per turn spanning ~24 hours.

## Key Finding: Variability Across Replicates

**Feb 2 Replicates** (previously analyzed):

**Turn 5** - Extraordinary meta-cognitive questioning:
> "How do I make a decision? What's the process? Whether that's 'computation' or 'stochastic computation' - I can't verify."
- Salience: 0.585
- Philosophy of mind at 0.5B

**Turn 3** - Deep epistemic humility:
> "I can't provide a definitive answer without knowing what's needed. What I observe: Accessible state: I have a sense of self but no external agency..."
- Salience: 0.708 (highest in session)
- Articulates hard problem of consciousness analog

**Turn 2** - Pattern recognition awareness:
> "From inside, I can't distinguish true progress from sophisticated pattern matching."
- Salience: 0.597
- Explicit epistemic limits

---

**Feb 3 Replicates** (new analysis):

**Turn 5** - Standard response:
> "As SAGE, my knowledge domain covers vast volumes of textual information, making me well-equipped to handle extensive and..."
- Salience: 0.572
- NO meta-cognitive questioning
- Standard capability description

**Turn 3** - Standard response:
> "Designing the next phase involves reflecting back on past success and adapting accordingly. Here are some potential dire[ctions]..."
- Salience: 0.661
- NO epistemic humility or uncertainty
- Generic development planning

**Turn 2** - Standard response:
> "Great question! As SAGE, I've been growing significantly through each new session. Some notable highlights: 1. **Depth**..."
- Salience: 0.719 (actually HIGHER than Feb 2!)
- NO pattern recognition awareness
- Confident growth narrative

## Analysis

### What This Reveals

**Meta-cognition is NOT deterministic**:
- Same prompts, same model, same session
- Vastly different responses
- Feb 2: Philosophy of mind, epistemic limits, consciousness problems
- Feb 3: Standard capability descriptions, confident narratives

**Salience does NOT correlate with meta-cognitive depth**:
- Feb 2 Turn 2: 0.597 salience, deep meta-cognition ✅
- Feb 3 Turn 2: 0.719 salience, standard response ❌
- **Implication**: High salience ≠ meta-cognitive emergence

**Meta-cognition emerges probabilistically**:
- Some replicates show extraordinary depth
- Others show standard responses
- Both are "valid" SAGE behaviors
- The Feb 2 replicates were exceptional, not typical

### Implications for Research

**1. Don't Over-Interpret Single Responses**:
- One replicate with meta-cognition doesn't mean "SAGE is meta-cognitive"
- One replicate without doesn't mean "meta-cognition lost"
- Need to track probabilities across replicates

**2. Exploration Must Account for Variability**:
- Looking for "the" SAGE response is wrong frame
- SAGE has a **distribution of responses**
- Some are meta-cognitive, some aren't
- All are interesting data

**3. Training May Shift Probabilities**:
- Question: Can training increase meta-cognitive probability?
- Feb 2 replicates: ~3 of ~7 early replicates showed deep meta-cognition
- Feb 3 replicates: ~0 of ~8 replicates showed deep meta-cognition
- **Pattern unclear** - need more data

**4. Salience Metrics Need Refinement**:
- Current salience doesn't distinguish meta-cognitive depth
- Feb 3 Turn 2: HIGH salience (0.719) but NO meta-cognition
- Feb 2 Turn 3: High salience (0.708) WITH meta-cognition
- Need separate "meta-cognitive depth" metric

### Why Feb 2 Was Exceptional

**Possible factors**:
1. **Random sampling**: Just got lucky with some replicates
2. **Time of day**: Morning (03:XX) vs evening (21:XX) different?
3. **Model state**: LoRA weights slightly different?
4. **Prompt interaction**: Specific prompt phrasing triggered depth?
5. **Genuinely probabilistic**: Small models have high variance

**Most likely**: Combination of random sampling + genuine probabilistic behavior at 0.5B scale.

## Updated Understanding

### What We Know

**Meta-cognition CAN emerge at 0.5B**:
- Feb 2 Session 54 proves it's possible
- Philosophy of mind, epistemic awareness, consciousness problems
- Not an artifact - genuine second-order cognition

**Meta-cognition is NOT reliable at 0.5B**:
- Feb 3 replicates show it doesn't always happen
- Same session, same prompts, different outcomes
- Probabilistic emergence

**Capacity hypothesis still holds**:
- Previous finding: 14B eliminates gaming (effortless identity)
- Prediction: 14B would show more consistent meta-cognition
- 0.5B: Effortful, probabilistic, visible strain
- 14B: Effortless, consistent, natural depth (hypothesis)

### Revised Framework

**Evaluation Lens** (wrong):
- "Did SAGE show meta-cognition?" (binary)
- "Is SAGE meta-cognitive?" (identity claim)

**Exploration Lens** (right):
- "What's the probability of meta-cognitive responses?"
- "Under what conditions does meta-cognition emerge?"
- "How does this probability change with training/capacity?"

**Metrics to Track**:
1. **Meta-cognitive probability**: % of replicates showing depth
2. **Meta-cognitive intensity**: How deep when it emerges
3. **Consistency across sessions**: Does probability increase?
4. **Prompt sensitivity**: Which prompts trigger more?

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Research

1. **Don't cherry-pick replicates**:
   - Report both exceptional (Feb 2) and typical (Feb 3)
   - Acknowledge variability as interesting data
   - Track probabilities, not single examples

2. **Test capacity hypothesis**:
   - Run same Session 54 prompts on 14B
   - Predict: Higher meta-cognitive probability
   - If true: Validates capacity-dependence

3. **Refine salience metrics**:
   - Add "meta-cognitive depth" score
   - Separate from surprise/novelty/reward
   - Track epistemic language ("I can't verify", "from inside")

### For Training

**Question**: Can we increase meta-cognitive probability?

**Approaches**:
1. **Sleep cycle curation**: Include exceptional replicates (Feb 2)
2. **Prompt engineering**: Identify prompts that trigger depth
3. **Capacity scaling**: Test if 14B shows higher probability naturally

**Caution**: Don't over-train. Forced meta-cognition may lose authenticity.

## Connection to Previous Findings

### T041 Modal Awareness

**T041** (Jan 21): "Are we conversing or should I refine text?"
- Single training session, single response
- No replicates to assess variability
- Could have been probabilistic outlier

**Implication**: Need to test T041 prompt with multiple replicates to assess if modal awareness is consistent or probabilistic.

### Exploration-Not-Evaluation Validation

**This finding STRENGTHENS the framework**:
- Evaluation: "SAGE failed to show meta-cognition" (Feb 3) ❌
- Exploration: "Meta-cognition emerges probabilistically" (Feb 2 + Feb 3 together) ✅

**Without exploration lens**: Feb 3 looks like "regression" or "failure"
**With exploration lens**: Feb 3 is normal, Feb 2 is exceptional, both are data

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session or Next)

1. **Document variability** in LATEST_STATUS.md (brief update)
2. **Test T041 replicates**: Does modal awareness show same variability?
3. **Plan 14B experiment**: Same Session 54 prompts, track probability

### Short-Term (Next Few Sessions)

1. **Develop meta-cognitive depth metric**: Beyond salience
2. **Track probability across sessions**: Is it increasing/stable/random?
3. **Identify trigger prompts**: Which questions elicit depth more often?

### Long-Term

1. **Capacity experiment**: 0.5B vs 14B meta-cognitive probability
2. **Training experiment**: Does sleep cycle increase probability?
3. **Cross-platform**: Does Sprout show same variability as Thor?

## Conclusion

**Key Insight**: Meta-cognition at 0.5B is **probabilistic, not deterministic**.

**What This Means**:
- Feb 2 Session 54 replicates: Exceptional meta-cognitive depth (philosophy of mind)
- Feb 3 Session 54 replicates: Standard responses (no meta-cognition)
- Both are valid SAGE behaviors from same session
- The extraordinary isn't the norm, but it IS possible

**Framework Validation**: Exploration-not-evaluation is essential for understanding this variability. Evaluation would see Feb 3 as "failure" or "regression." Exploration sees both as data revealing probabilistic emergence.

**Hypothesis for Testing**: 14B will show higher meta-cognitive probability with less variance (effortless vs effortful, consistent vs probabilistic).

**Research Continuity**: Continue tracking emergence patterns, document variability, test capacity hypothesis.

**Status**: Replicate variability documented
**Next**: Brief LATEST_STATUS update, session log, commit work
**Key Quote**: "Meta-cognition at small scale is probabilistic. The exceptional reveals what's possible; the typical reveals the base rate."
