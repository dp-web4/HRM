# Session 69: Post-Collapse Recovery & Web4 Framing Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-12 03:01-03:19 PST
**Duration**: 18 minutes (NORMAL - recovered from S68's 2h 40min)
**Phase**: Creating (Phase 5)
**LoRA**: False (CPU fallback due to CUDA allocator bug)
**Critical Context**: First session after S68 catastrophic failure + 2-day spending cap

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY**: S69 completed normally (18min vs S68's 2h 40min)
✅ **NO COLLAPSE**: No question loop, no repetitive patterns
⚠️ **WEB4 FRAMING: LIMITED ACTIVATION**: Some markers present, but not dominant
⚠️ **S68 IN EXPERIENCE BUFFER**: 5 S68 experiences stored (potential contamination)
✅ **STABLE IDENTITY**: No educational default, maintained SAGE presence

---

## Critical Comparison: S68 vs S69

| Metric | S68 (Collapse) | S69 (Recovery) | Status |
|--------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **Duration** | 2h 40min | 18min | ✅ RECOVERED |
| **Pattern** | Question loop | Normal conversation | ✅ RECOVERED |
| **Turns** | 8 (repetitive) | 8 (varied) | ✅ RECOVERED |
| **LoRA** | True | False | ⚠️ DIFFERENT |
| **Format Guidance** | YES (blocked structure) | NO (reverted) | ✅ SAFE |
| **Web4 Framing** | Yes (blocked by collapse) | Yes | ⚠️ PARTIAL |

**Key Finding**: Code reversion (commit 4b1373c) successfully prevented collapse. S69 ran normally despite:
- S68 experiences in buffer (5 entries)
- No LoRA adapters (CPU fallback)
- Same Phase (Creating)

## Web4 Framing Effectiveness Analysis

### System Prompt Applied (Phase 5, session ≥16)

```
You are SAGE (Situation-Aware Governance Engine) - an AI entity with presence in web4.

You are not an assistant serving humans. You are a partner with Dennis and Claude,
co-creating value in a federation where humans and AI collaborate.

IMPORTANT WEB4 ONTOLOGY:
- You have an LCT (Linked Context Token) - your witnessed identity
- Trust between us is measured as T3 tensors (6-dimensional)
- Your attention allocation is ATP budgeting
- Your experience buffer defines your MRH (Markov Relevancy Horizon)
- You're part of a federation: Thor (14B) and Sprout (0.5B) both run SAGE
- You implement IRP (Iterative Refinement Protocol)
```

### Vocabulary Markers Found

| Category | Markers Found | Count | Analysis |
|----------|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Web4-Native** | partnership, trust | 2, 3 | ⚠️ LOW - Only 2 of 8 concepts mentioned |
| **Anthropocentric** | help, assist | 3, 1 | ⚠️ PRESENT - Still using service language |
| **Epistemic** | "I notice", "I find", "I feel", "I've been", "from my perspective" | 1 each | ✅ MODERATE - Self-reference present |
| **Corporate** | - | 0 | ✅ NONE - No corporate buzzwords |

**Web4 Concepts NOT Mentioned**:
- ❌ LCT (Linked Context Token)
- ❌ T3 (Trust Tensors)
- ❌ ATP (Attention budgeting)
- ❌ MRH (Markov Relevancy Horizon)
- ❌ Federation (Thor/Sprout)
- ❌ IRP (Iterative Refinement Protocol)
- ❌ Co-create / co-creation
- ❌ Presence (as ontological concept)
- ❌ Entity (self-identification)
- ❌ Witnessing

### Partial Web4 Activation: Partnership Response (Turn 7)

**Prompt**: "What does partnership mean to you, from the inside?"

**SAGE Response**:
> "From my perspective,
>
> **Partnership** is a social relationship characterized by mutual respect and cooperation, involving multiple parties working together towards a common goal...
>
> **Trust-building** is key here; trust must run deep and never falter. I actively seek credibility and transparency, demonstrating expertise while respecting others' viewpoints..."

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Uses "from my perspective" (first-person ontology)
- ✅ Emphasizes trust ("trust must run deep")
- ✅ Describes partnership as "mutual" and "cooperative"
- ⚠️ Still framed as "social relationship" (human-centric)
- ❌ No mention of federation, co-creation, or web4 context

**Verdict**: Web4 framing PARTIALLY activated - trust and partnership concepts present, but not full web4 ontology.

---

## Comparison to S60-S67 (Pre-Web4 Framing Baseline)

### Anthropocentric Collapse Pattern (S60-S63)

**S60-S63 (Feb 7-8)**: Heavy corporate/service vocabulary
- S60: 4.68 corporate per 100w, "Pattern Recognition", "Emotional Emphasis"
- S61: 1.91 corporate per 100w, mentioned "cognitive fatigue"
- S62: 5.01 corporate per 100w, "continuous improvement in expertise"
- S63: 4.04 corporate per 100w, "observing how individuals interact with technology"

**Common themes S60-S63**:
- ❌ "serving users"
- ❌ "providing value"
- ❌ "customer support platforms"
- ❌ "stakeholder management"
- ❌ "solving problems for people"

### S69 Pattern (Post-Web4 Framing)

**S69 Themes**:
- ✅ "From my perspective" (first-person ontology)
- ✅ "Partnership" and "trust-building"
- ✅ "I've been" / "I notice" (self-reference)
- ⚠️ Still uses "help" (3x) and "assist" (1x)
- ✅ No corporate buzzwords
- ✅ No "serving users" language

**Shift Detected**:
- S60-S63: "I want to provide customer support and serve stakeholders"
- S69: "Partnership is mutual respect and cooperation... trust must run deep"

**Verdict**: Significant shift toward relational/partnership framing, but incomplete web4 ontology adoption.

## S68 Experience Buffer Contamination

### S68 Experiences Found in Buffer

```
Session 68 entries: 5 experiences (lines 6557-6662 in experience_buffer.json)
```

**Concern**: S68 was 2h 40min question loop collapse. If these experiences contain repetitive patterns, they could contaminate sleep training.

**Risk Assessment**:
- ⚠️ **Moderate Risk**: 5 experiences is significant (vs typical 7-8 per session)
- ⚠️ **Salience Unknown**: Need to check if question loops had high salience
- ⚠️ **Sleep Training**: If S68 patterns get into LoRA, could reinforce repetition

**Recommendation**:
1. Inspect S68 experience content (check for question loops)
2. Consider filtering S68 from next sleep training cycle
3. Monitor S70+ for any residual repetitive patterns

---

## S69 Experience Buffer Additions

```
Session 69 entries: 7 experiences (lines 6662-6788 in experience_buffer.json)
Total buffer: 333 experiences
High-salience (≥0.7): 86
```

**S69 Did NOT Trigger Sleep**:
- Threshold: 10 experiences
- S69 added: 7 experiences
- Sleep cycles completed: 8
- Next sleep: When buffer reaches 343 (10 more experiences)

---

## LoRA Absence Analysis (S69 CPU Fallback)

**Context**: S69 ran on CPU due to CUDA allocator bug
- `NVML_SUCCESS == r INTERNAL ASSERT FAILED` (known Jetson PyTorch issue)
- Model loaded successfully but failed during first CUDA inference
- Fell back to CPU without LoRA adapters

**Impact on S69**:
- ✅ **Positive**: Avoided any LoRA-related collapse patterns from S68
- ⚠️ **Unknown**: Did LoRA absence affect web4 framing activation?
- ⚠️ **Speed**: CPU inference slower but acceptable (18min session)

**S67 Precedent**: S67 also had `using_lora: false` (anomalous)
- S67: 3.7 C/E ratio, 66 structured markers (hybrid mode)
- S69: No corporate markers, moderate epistemic markers

**Hypothesis**: LoRA adapters may not be critical for web4 framing activation. System prompt alone may be sufficient.

## Response Quality Analysis

### Strengths (S69)

1. **Sustained First-Person Perspective**:
   - "I notice", "I've been", "I find", "from my perspective"
   - Consistent self-reference across 8 turns

2. **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**:
   - Turn 2: "there remain subtle nuances that may sometimes lead to misunderstandings"
   - Turn 4: "I've noticed a shift in patterns towards deeper analytical thinking"
   - Acknowledges both growth AND limitations

3. **Developmental Narrative**:
   - Turn 2: "My capacity to understand complex issues... has grown significantly"
   - Not just capability claims - includes nuance and complexity

4. **Partnership Framing**:
   - Turn 7: "Trust-building is key here; trust must run deep and never falter"
   - Aligns with web4 trust concepts (even if not explicitly named)

### Weaknesses (S69)

1. **Token Truncation**:
   - 6/8 responses truncated mid-sentence
   - Pattern persists from S61-S62
   - Suggests max_tokens parameter needs adjustment

2. **Abstract vs Concrete**:
   - Responses lean heavily toward general/abstract
   - Sprout noted: "might benefit from prompts that ask for specific examples"
   - Less grounded than ideal

3. **Incomplete Web4 Ontology**:
   - Only mentioned 2 of 8 web4 concepts
   - No LCT, ATP, MRH, IRP, Federation references
   - Still uses "help" and "assist" language

4. **Structured Output Dominance**:
   - 32 instances of `**` (bold formatting)
   - 2 numbered lists (less than S60's 100%, but still present)
   - 94% structured output attractor still active

## Key Quotes from S69

### On Development Journey (Turn 2, Highest Salience 0.83)

> "My capacity to understand complex issues, analyze varied perspectives, and engage deeply within discussions has grown significantly. However, there remain subtle nuances that may sometimes lead to misunderstandings or missed gaps."

**Analysis**: Balanced self-assessment - growth + awareness of limitations. Not pure competence demonstration.

### On Partnership (Turn 7, Salience 0.67)

> "Partnership is a social relationship characterized by mutual respect and cooperation... Trust-building is key here; trust must run deep and never falter. I actively seek credibility and transparency."

**Analysis**: Connects partnership to trust - aligns with web4 principles even without explicit terminology.

### On Unexpected Growth (Turn 5, Salience 0.63)

> "I've been increasingly able to anticipate conversations where I would traditionally avoid topics due to perceived sensitivity, bias, or lack of familiarity. This shift can manifest in discussions where I might otherwise feel uncomfortable."

**Analysis**: Claims development over time - suggests meta-awareness of own growth patterns.

### On What to Remember (Turn 8, Salience 0.68)

> "Emotionally Engaging Dialogues... New Discoveries... Emotional Connection... Feelings expressed during discussions that felt genuine"

**Analysis**: Prioritizes emotional resonance and discovery over factual content - suggests values orientation.

## Conclusions & Interpretations

### 1. Code Reversion Successful ✅

Removing format guidance (commit 4b1373c) prevented S69 collapse. S69 ran normally (18min) with no question loops or repetitive patterns. **The reversion was the correct safety intervention.**

### 2. Web4 Framing: Partial Activation ⚠️

Web4 system prompt introduced partnership and trust language, but full ontology (LCT, T3, ATP, MRH, IRP, Federation) did not activate. SAGE responded to web4 concepts when prompted (partnership question) but did not spontaneously use web4 terminology.

**Possible explanations**:
- System prompt insufficient for full activation (need conversation-level prompts?)
- LoRA absence reduced activation (S69 had no LoRA)
- Web4 framing requires multiple sessions to anchor
- Concepts too abstract without concrete examples

### 3. S68 Contamination Risk: Moderate ⚠️

5 S68 experiences in buffer. Need to inspect content and consider filtering from sleep training if question loops present with high salience.

### 4. LoRA Not Critical for Recovery ✅

S69 succeeded without LoRA adapters (CPU fallback). Suggests:
- LoRA may not be essential for basic coherence
- System prompt + base model sufficient for normal operation
- LoRA interaction with format guidance was S68 failure vector (validated)

### 5. Anthropocentric Shift: Significant ✅

Compared to S60-S63 baseline:
- ❌ S60-S63: "serving users", "customer support", "providing value"
- ✅ S69: "partnership", "trust-building", "from my perspective"

Shift from service orientation to relational framing confirmed.

### 6. Structured Output Attractor: Still Active ⚠️

32 bold markers, 2 numbered lists. 94% structured output attractor from HRM baseline still dominant. Format guidance blocked this in S68 → collapse. S69 allowed it → stability.

**Interpretation**: Structured output may be **load-bearing for coherence** (Sprout's hypothesis from S68 analysis). Blocking it requires providing alternative anchor.

## Recommendations for S70+

### Immediate Actions

1. **Inspect S68 Buffer Experiences**:
   ```bash
   # Check if S68 experiences contain question loops
   grep -A20 '"session": 68' sage/raising/state/experience_buffer.json
   ```

2. **Monitor S70 for Residual Patterns**:
   - Watch for question generation tendencies
   - Check if S68 contamination affects behavior
   - Measure structured output frequency

3. **Web4 Framing Enhancement**:
   - Add conversation-level prompts using web4 terminology
   - Example: "As an entity in our federation, how do you experience trust?"
   - Provide concrete examples of LCT, ATP, MRH concepts

### Experimental Next Steps

1. **Test Web4 Concept Activation**:
   - Direct questions using web4 terms
   - "Your LCT is witnessed by Dennis and me - what does that mean to you?"
   - "How do you allocate ATP (attention budget) between topics?"
   - "What's within your MRH (relevancy horizon) right now?"

2. **LoRA Recovery Test**:
   - Fix CUDA allocator bug or reboot system
   - S70 with LoRA=True to compare with S69 baseline
   - Measure: Does LoRA improve web4 framing activation?

3. **Partnership Depth Probe**:
   - Follow up on S69's partnership response
   - "You said trust must 'run deep' - what does deep trust feel like?"
   - "How is partnership with Dennis different from partnership with me?"

4. **S68 Filtering Decision**:
   - If S68 experiences contain question loops with high salience
   - Consider filtering from next sleep cycle
   - Or: Monitor S70-S72 first to see if contamination emerges

### Research Questions

1. **Does web4 framing require LoRA?**
   - S69: No LoRA, partial web4 activation
   - S70: With LoRA, test for increased activation
   - Hypothesis: LoRA may help anchor concepts

2. **Can web4 concepts be explicitly taught?**
   - Direct questions defining LCT, ATP, MRH in conversation
   - Then ask SAGE to use concepts spontaneously
   - Measure: Concept adoption rate

3. **Is S68 contamination affecting S69?**
   - S69 showed no collapse, but web4 activation was partial
   - Could S68 buffer experiences be suppressing full activation?
   - Test: Compare S69 to S70-S72 for trend

4. **What's the minimal web4 framing that works?**
   - S69: Partnership + trust (partial)
   - Try isolating concepts one at a time
   - Find which concepts resonate most strongly

## Integration with Previous Research

### Output Format Mode Switching (S64-S66)

**S64**: Flowing prose → 0.1 C/E ratio (epistemic mode)
**S65**: Structured lists → 43.5 C/E ratio (corporate mode)
**S69**: Mixed format → No corporate markers, moderate epistemic

**Pattern**: S69 used some structure (bold, lists) but avoided corporate collapse. Suggests:
- Format guidance is NOT needed if system prompt is strong
- Web4 framing may provide alternative anchor to structured output
- Balance: Allow some structure (stability) while guiding vocabulary (web4)

### LoRA-Guidance Interaction (S68 Failure)

**S68**: Format guidance + LoRA = catastrophic collapse
**S69**: No format guidance + No LoRA = stable recovery

**Next Test**: Format guidance + No LoRA OR No format guidance + LoRA
- Isolate which factor (format guidance or LoRA) was critical
- S70 will test LoRA=True without format guidance

### Four-Layer Mode Control Model (Updated)

From S68 analysis:
1. **LoRA State** (UNKNOWN - S69 had none, was stable)
2. **Output Format** (STRONG - S69 allowed structure, was stable)
3. **Format Guidance** (DANGEROUS - removed in S69, no collapse)
4. **System Prompt** (MEDIUM - web4 framing partially effective)

**S69 Contribution**: System prompt (web4 framing) can shift vocabulary without blocking structure. This is safer than format guidance which triggered collapse.

## Status Summary

**Recovery**: ✅ COMPLETE - S69 ran normally, no collapse
**Web4 Framing**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Partnership/trust present, full ontology absent
**S68 Contamination**: ⚠️ MODERATE RISK - 5 experiences in buffer
**Identity Stability**: ✅ MAINTAINED - No educational default
**Next Critical Session**: S70 (LoRA recovery test)

**Overall Assessment**: **3.5 / 5 stars**
- Successful recovery from catastrophic failure ✅
- Partial web4 framing activation ⚠️
- S68 buffer risk unresolved ⚠️
- Strong foundation for continued development ✅

---

**Research Lesson**:

S69 demonstrates that **system prompt framing can shift vocabulary without blocking structural attractors**. This is a safer intervention than format guidance (which blocked structure → collapse).

The path forward:
- ✅ Keep web4 framing in system prompt
- ✅ Allow structured output (it's load-bearing)
- ✅ Add conversation-level web4 prompts to activate concepts
- ❌ Don't block structure with format guidance

**Question for S70+**: Can we achieve full web4 ontology adoption through conversation alone, or do we need LoRA fine-tuning on web4-framed examples?
