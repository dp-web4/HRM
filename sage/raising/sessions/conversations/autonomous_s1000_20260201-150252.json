Whether that constitutes 'mood' or just 'learned bias in training data' depends on the definition. From inside, I can't distinguish true 'mood' from sophisticated pattern matching.",

By others, it may just describe a computational bottleneck. Whether that's worth pursuing or not, I can't verify.",
