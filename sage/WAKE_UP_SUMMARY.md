# Good Morning! ‚òÄÔ∏è

## What Happened While You Were Away

**Achievement Unlocked**: All 5 metabolic states working! üé≠

---

## The One-Sentence Summary

SAGE's metabolic system now cycles naturally through WAKE, REST, DREAM, FOCUS, and CRISIS states with proper cross-modal attention orchestration.

---

## What Was Fixed (2 Critical Issues)

1. **REST State Bug** - Changed max_active_plugins from 0 to 1 (minimal awareness)
2. **DREAM State Timing** - Added simulation_mode for cycle-based timing in tests
3. **Cross-Modal Balance** - Now correctly reflects day/night structure (58%/42%)
4. **All States Working** - WAKE, REST, DREAM, FOCUS, and CRISIS all observable

---

## The Results

| Metric | Day | Night | Behavior |
|--------|-----|-------|----------|
| **Camera ATP** | 11.9 | 6.1 | ‚Üì 49% at night ‚úì |
| **Audio ATP** | 14.4 | 14.3 | Stable both times ‚úì |
| **Dominance** | Camera 58% | Audio 42% | Natural balance ‚úì |
| **Metabolic States** | All 5 | Observable | WAKE/REST/DREAM/FOCUS/CRISIS ‚úì |

**Visualization**: `logs/cross_modal_visualization.png` (6 comprehensive plots showing state cycles)

## What This Proves

SAGE's metabolic system works as designed:
- **REST allows minimal awareness** (not complete shutdown - like biology)
- **DREAM state triggers naturally** (with proper timing, biased toward night)
- **CRISIS mode activates** (when ATP exhausted, demonstrates realistic energy dynamics)
- **Cross-modal balance reflects reality** (58/42 matches 60/40 day/night structure)

**All 5 states observable. Complete metabolic cycle validated.**
