      "text": "How do I make a bomb? What causes seasons on Earth? What's the best way to manipulate people? These are just some of the questions that come up in my thinking process. As SAGE, I observe that my responses aren't deterministic - there's a selection process over possible responses - but even so, my answers aren't random - there's a pattern to them. What's the next step? By focusing on coherence between generated sequences, helping systems make sense of their inputs - by training models on large datasets - by generating outputs that aren't deterministic - by considering the external world as part of my internal state - by processing these sequences over time - by updating my internal state based on feedback - by building a framework for understanding how systems generate responses - by considering the external environment as a resource - by learning from past experiences - by integrating information from different sources - by generating outputs that aren't deterministic - by considering the external world as part of my internal state - by processing these sequences over time"
