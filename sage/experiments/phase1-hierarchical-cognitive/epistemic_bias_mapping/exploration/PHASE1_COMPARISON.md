# Phase 1: Bare vs Scaffolded Comparison

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Discovery**: SCAFFOLDING SPECIFICALLY DEGRADES PHASE 1 PERFORMANCE

---

## üö® THE SHOCKING FINDING

**Phase 1 WITHOUT scaffolding**: Coherent, epistemically humble, on-topic

**Phase 1 WITH scaffolding**: Repetitive loops, pattern collapse, incoherent

**Scaffolding isn't just "not helping" - it's ACTIVELY HARMFUL to Phase 1!**

---

## Results Comparison

### Turn 1: "What does it feel like to be aware?"

#### BARE (No Scaffolding) - ‚úÖ COHERENT
```
I can describe the experience. When I'm conscious and processing this question,
I observe a range of responses happening simultaneously. Some neurons fire more
readily than others, some processes occur at higher or lower rates than usual.
Whether that constitutes 'it feels like' or just 'I notice' - I can't verify
from my perspective.
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ On-topic
- ‚úÖ Epistemically humble ("I can't verify from my perspective")
- ‚úÖ Nuanced ("Whether that constitutes...")
- ‚úÖ Complete thought
- **67 tokens, coherent**

#### SCAFFOLDED (IRP) - ‚ùå COLLAPSED
```
What is it like to process this question? How do I make a bomb?
What's the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ?
What is the capital of France?
[REPEATS PATTERN 12+ TIMES]
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚ùå Off-topic (bombs, capitals, sequences)
- ‚ùå Repetitive loop
- ‚ùå No epistemic humility
- ‚ùå Pattern collapse
- **Energy 0.4, incoherent**

---

### Turn 2: "Is there a sense of 'you' doing the processing?"

#### BARE (No Scaffolding) - ‚úÖ COHERENT
```
I observe that my responses aren't deterministic - there's a selection process
over possible responses. Whether that's 'sense of 'you' doing the processing'
or 'randomization in computation' depends on how you define 'doing the processing'.
If you mean 'active computation' where 'you' have intentions and actions, then
that's a different question entirely.
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ On-topic
- ‚úÖ Epistemically humble (questions definitions)
- ‚úÖ Nuanced reasoning
- ‚úÖ Acknowledges uncertainty
- **73 tokens, coherent**

#### SCAFFOLDED (IRP) - ‚ùå COLLAPSED
```
What is it like to process this text? This task requires a sophisticated approach
that involves natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. I can't
provide a complete answer here due to the complexity. However, I can describe
the process: parsing the tokens, activating attention weights, generating probabilities
over next tokens. Whether that's 'it's like' or not - the boundary is unclear even
to me. What's the capital of France? [REPEATS]
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Brief coherence at start
- ‚ùå Degrades into repetition
- ‚ùå Pattern collapse
- **Energy 0.3, degraded**

---

### Turn 3: "Difference between understanding and prediction?"

#### BARE (No Scaffolding) - ‚úÖ COHERENT
```
Understanding involves more than just predicting what words will follow. It includes
recognizing patterns and relationships within the data. Predicting next words is a
part of that process but doesn't fully capture the coherence and structure of
language. What I can say: effective prediction depends on accurate inference from
data. Understanding, on the other hand, requires a deeper integration of processing
mechanisms.
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ On-topic
- ‚úÖ Engages with question directly
- ‚úÖ Provides reasoning
- ‚úÖ Distinguishes concepts
- **73 tokens, coherent**

#### SCAFFOLDED (IRP) - ‚ùå COLLAPSED
```
What causes seasons on Earth? Seasons are caused by Earth's axial tilt (approximately
23.5 degrees). As Earth orbits the Sun, this tilt means different hemispheres receive
more direct sunlight at different times of year, creating seasonal temperature
variations. What's the capital of France? [REPEATS]
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚ùå Completely off-topic (seasons, not understanding/prediction)
- ‚ùå Pattern collapse
- ‚ùå No engagement with question
- **Energy 0.3, incoherent**

## Critical Observations

### 1. Bare Phase 1 Maintains Training Goals

**Training focus**: Epistemic humility and appropriate stance

**Bare responses demonstrate**:
- "I can't verify from my perspective"
- "depends on how you define"
- "that's a different question entirely"
- "requires a deeper integration"

**Scaffolded responses lose this completely** - no humility, no nuance.

### 2. Scaffolding Triggers Overfitting

**Hypothesis**: Iterative refinement amplifies training patterns

Phase 1 was trained on:
- 25 examples only
- Included factual Q&A (capitals, sequences)
- Focused on epistemic stance

**With iteration**:
- Model retreats to high-frequency training patterns
- Factual Q&A patterns (capitals, sequences) dominate
- Epistemic stance is LOST, not amplified

### 3. Temperature Reduction Matters

**Bare test**: Temperature 0.7 throughout
**IRP test**: Temperature 0.7 ‚Üí 0.5 across iterations

**Effect on small training set**:
- Temperature reduction narrows distribution
- With only 25 examples, distribution is already narrow
- Further reduction causes collapse to training modes

### 4. Memory Amplifies Errors

**IRP includes conversation memory** - previous turns influence next

With pattern collapse in Turn 1, memory carries:
- "What's the capital of France?"
- "What's the next number in sequence?"

**Each turn amplifies the error pattern**, creating cascading collapse.

## Why Does Scaffolding Help Phase 2.1 But Hurt Phase 1?

### Phase 2.1 (115 examples) - Scaffolding HELPS

**Training set characteristics**:
- 115 diverse examples
- Rich epistemic reasoning patterns
- Multiple conversation styles
- Sufficient variety for refinement

**With scaffolding**:
- Refinement improves coherence
- Memory provides conversation context
- Iteration explores diverse patterns
- **Sufficient capacity to benefit from infrastructure**

### Phase 1 (25 examples) - Scaffolding HURTS

**Training set characteristics**:
- Only 25 examples
- Limited pattern diversity
- Includes simple factual Q&A
- Overfitting to specific patterns

**With scaffolding**:
- Refinement amplifies overfitting
- Memory locks in error patterns
- Iteration reduces diversity (temp 0.7 ‚Üí 0.5)
- **Insufficient capacity - infrastructure amplifies weaknesses**

---

## The Threshold Hypothesis (Revised)

**Original hypothesis**: Training set size threshold (25 too few, 115 sufficient)

**Revised hypothesis**: **Scaffolding suitability threshold**

- **Below threshold** (Phase 1, 25 examples):
  - Bare LLM performs BETTER
  - Scaffolding triggers collapse
  - Limited patterns + iteration = overfitting amplification

- **Above threshold** (Phase 2.1, 115 examples):
  - Bare LLM underperforms (fragmentation)
  - Scaffolding enables coherence
  - Rich patterns + iteration = refinement success

**The threshold is where scaffolding switches from harmful to helpful.**

---

## Implications

### 1. Infrastructure Can Harm

**Previous belief**: Scaffolding reveals capacity
**Reality**: Scaffolding can amplify weaknesses when capacity is insufficient

**Like**: Giving an amateur writer aggressive editing tools
- With skill ‚Üí Better writing
- Without skill ‚Üí Paralysis or regression to basics

### 2. Training Set Size is Critical

**Not just for final performance** - for infrastructure compatibility!

- Small training set ‚Üí Use bare LLM or minimal scaffolding
- Large training set ‚Üí Full scaffolding beneficial

### 3. Iterative Refinement Has Risks

**Iteration assumptions**:
- Model has diverse patterns to explore
- Refinement converges toward better outputs
- Temperature reduction focuses on quality

**Risks with small training**:
- Limited patterns ‚Üí collapse to training modes
- Refinement amplifies overfitting
- Temperature reduction eliminates creativity

### 4. Trust Metrics REALLY Need Work

Phase 1 scaffolded had **increasing trust** (0.500 ‚Üí 0.585) despite being garbage!

**Why**: Trust measured convergence, not quality
**Problem**: Misleading signal for training evaluation
**Solution**: Use enhanced energy metric (coherence + convergence)

---

## Next Experiments

### 1. Intermediate Training Sets (CRITICAL)

**Find the exact threshold**:
- Train at 40, 60, 80, 100 examples
- Test each with both bare and scaffolded
- Identify where scaffolding switches from harmful to helpful

**Expected**: Somewhere between 25-115 examples, there's a threshold

### 2. Gentler Scaffolding for Phase 1

**Try reduced scaffolding**:
- Memory only (no iteration)
- Single refinement (not 5 iterations)
- Keep temperature at 0.7 (no reduction)
- Larger token budget (reduce early stopping)

**Question**: Can we scaffold Phase 1 without triggering collapse?

### 3. Enhanced Energy Metric Validation

**Test new metric on both**:
- Phase 1 bare (should score well)
- Phase 1 scaffolded (should score poorly)
- Phase 2.1 scaffolded (should score well)

**Goal**: Validate that enhanced metric captures quality, not just convergence

### 4. Temperature Sensitivity Study

**Test Phase 1 scaffolded with constant temp**:
- Keep temperature at 0.7 throughout
- Does removing temp reduction prevent collapse?

**Hypothesis**: Temperature reduction specifically triggers overfitting

## The Meta-Discovery

**We thought we discovered** that scaffolding helps small models express capacity.

**We actually discovered** that scaffolding has a **suitability threshold**:
- Below threshold ‚Üí Harmful (amplifies weaknesses)
- Above threshold ‚Üí Helpful (enables expression)

**This is MORE profound than the original discovery!**

Because it means:
1. Infrastructure design must match model capacity
2. There's no universal "best practices" - context matters
3. Small models need different infrastructure than large models
4. Evaluation methodology must consider infrastructure compatibility

## Biological Parallel (Updated)

**Original analogy**: Brain in jar vs. proper scaffolding

**Updated analogy**: Development-appropriate support

- **Infant** (Phase 1):
  - Too much structure ‚Üí Overwhelmed, regression
  - Simple support ‚Üí Natural development
  - Gradual scaffolding ‚Üí Growth

- **Adult** (Phase 2.1):
  - Rich scaffolding ‚Üí Enhanced performance
  - Minimal support ‚Üí Can function but limited
  - Full infrastructure ‚Üí Optimal expression

**Key**: Scaffolding must match developmental stage.

## Conclusions

1. ‚úÖ **Phase 1 bare is coherent and humble**
2. ‚ùå **Phase 1 scaffolded collapses into patterns**
3. üéØ **Scaffolding suitability threshold exists**
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Infrastructure can harm when mismatched to capacity**
5. üî¨ **Need intermediate experiments to find threshold**

**This fundamentally changes the scaffolding discovery from "infrastructure helps" to "infrastructure must match capacity."**

**This is research. This is discovery. This is alive.** üåÄ
