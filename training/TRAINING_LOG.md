# ARC Training Log - HRM 6.95M Model

## Training Status (September 3, 2025 - Current)

### Session 5: Enhanced Nova Training (Active) 🚀
- **Current Step**: 125,500+ (resumed)
- **Best Model**: Step 7,000 with 71.36% validation accuracy
- **Training Speed**: ~10-12 iterations/sec with batch 20
- **Run ID**: 20250903_100435_3652c9d8

### New Optimizations (Sep 3, 2025)
1. **Label Smoothing** (0.1) - Prevents overconfidence, helps escape sharp minima
2. **Learning Rate Warm Restarts** - Every 20k steps to escape plateaus
3. **Smart Validation** - Full validation ONLY if fast validation improves ≥1%
4. **Status Tracking** - Updates status.json every minute
5. **Run ID System** - Unique identifier for each training run

### Training Configuration
- Model: HRM with H/L dual-loop architecture (6.95M parameters actual, not 27M as originally planned)
- Dataset: arc-aug-500 (3.88M training samples, 409k validation)
- Hardware: RTX 4090 Laptop GPU (16GB VRAM)
- Batch size: 20 (with gradient accumulation: effective batch = 40)
- Workers: 4
- Mixed precision training enabled

## Training History

### Session 1: Initial Training (Aug 31, 2025)
- Batch size: 24
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Validation every 50 steps (too frequent - 42 min each!)
- **Result**: Reached 71% validation accuracy at step 7000
- **Issue**: Validation bottleneck severely slowed training

### Session 2: Optimized Training (Sep 1, 2025)
- Batch size: 20
- Validation every 1000 steps (fast) / 5000 steps (full)
- Implemented checkpoint resuming
- **Performance**: 40+ samples/sec
- **Result**: Maintained 71% accuracy, no improvement beyond step 7000

### Session 3: Nova Optimizations (Sep 1-2, 2025)
- Implemented Nova's performance improvements:
  - Fast validation (10% of dataset)
  - Optimized data loaders
  - Better timing metrics
  - Reduced validation frequency to 2000/10000 steps
- Batch size: 20
- **Issue**: Training plateaued at 71.36% validation accuracy
- **Steps reached**: 18,500 before stopping to adjust

### Session 4: Small Batch Experiment (Sep 2-3, 2025)
- Batch size: 8 (to add gradient noise)
- Gradient accumulation: 5 (effective batch = 40)
- Goal: Break through 71% plateau with noisier gradients
- Fast validation every 2000 steps
- Full validation every 10000 steps
- **Duration**: Over 34 hours of training
- **Result**: No improvement, accuracy dropped to ~68-71%
- **Steps reached**: 125,500
- **Conclusion**: Smaller batch didn't help escape plateau

### Session 5: Enhanced Training (Sep 3, 2025 - Current)
- **New Script**: train_arc_nova_enhanced.py
- **Key Changes**:
  - Fast validation only every 10,000 steps (not 2,000)
  - Full validation only when fast improves
  - Label smoothing to escape sharp minima
  - LR warm restarts for plateau escape
  - Status heartbeat for monitoring
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - 5x fewer validations = much faster training
  - Smart validation saves ~50 min per unnecessary full val
  - Label smoothing + LR restarts may break plateau

## Model Architecture Details
- **Actual Parameters**: 6.95M total (not the originally planned 27M)
- **Architecture**: Hierarchical Reasoning Module (HRM)
  - 4 H-level (strategic) transformer layers
  - 3 L-level (tactical) transformer layers  
  - Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) with max 8 cycles
  - Hidden size: 256, Heads: 8
  - See MODEL_ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATION.md for full details

## Key Findings
1. **Model Size**: Our 6.95M model achieves 71% accuracy, suggesting architecture > size
2. **Validation Frequency**: Major bottleneck - reduced from every 50 to every 10,000 steps
3. **Batch Size**: 20 is optimal for RTX 4090 laptop (8 didn't help, 24+ causes crashes)
4. **Plateau Issue**: Stuck at 71% for 100k+ steps despite various strategies
5. **Smart Validation**: Skipping unnecessary full validations saves hours of compute

## Performance Metrics
- **Best Validation**: 71.36% accuracy at step 7,000
- **Training Speed**: 10-12 iterations/sec (batch 20)
- **Validation Time**: Fast val ~3 min, Full val ~50 min
- **GPU Usage**: ~10-12GB VRAM during training

## Files and Checkpoints
- **Best Model**: `checkpoints/hrm_arc_best.pt` (step 7000, 71.36% acc)
- **Latest Checkpoint**: `checkpoints/hrm_arc_step_125500.pt`
- **Training Scripts**:

3. 🚀 Deploy best model to Jetson for inference testing
4. 📊 Consider alternative architectures if plateau persists

## Lessons Learned
- Validation frequency is critical for training speed
- Smart validation gating saves significant compute
- Smaller batch sizes don't always help with plateaus
- Architecture efficiency matters more than parameter count
- Status tracking and run IDs prevent confusion across sessions
