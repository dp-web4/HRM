# SAGE as IRP Situational Awareness Orchestrator

## Paradigm Shift: From Puzzle Solver to Resource Coordinator

SAGE's true purpose is not to solve abstract reasoning puzzles but to orchestrate real-world sensors and actuators with trust awareness and resource constraints.

## Core Mission

SAGE operates as a **Situational Awareness Orchestrator** that:
1. **Understands** the current situation from multiple sensor inputs
2. **Decides** what needs attention based on salience and trust
3. **Invokes** the most trustworthy resources for tasks
4. **Provides** R6 confidence context for actions

## Architecture in IRP Context

### Input Layer: Sensor Fusion
- Multiple sensor types (temperature, camera, microphone, etc.)
- Each sensor has T3 trust metrics (Talent, Training, Temperament)
- Energy cost (ATP) for querying each sensor
- Confidence scores for readings

### Processing: H/L Dual System
- **H-Level (Strategic)**: Complex situation analysis, anomaly detection
- **L-Level (Tactical)**: Routine monitoring, fast responses
- Dynamic routing based on situation complexity

### Output Layer: Actuator Coordination
- Available actuators with capability lists
- Reliability scores from historical performance
- Energy costs and response times
- R6 context generation for confident action

## Training Philosophy

### Not ARC-AGI: Real Situations
Instead of abstract puzzles, SAGE trains on realistic scenarios:
- **Emergency Response**: Detect anomaly â†’ Activate appropriate alarm
- **Routine Monitoring**: Track trends â†’ Report status
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify outliers â†’ Investigate
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimize energy while maintaining coverage
- **User Interaction**: Detect presence â†’ Respond appropriately
- **Maintenance Check**: Verify all systems operational

### Web4-Zero Integration
Following Sprout's insight, we use physical constraints as training signals:
```python
constraints = {
    'power_watts': 15.0,      # Actual hardware limit
    'memory_gb': 4.0,         # Physical RAM
    'temperature_c': 75.0,    # Thermal threshold  
    'deadline_seconds': 10.0  # Real-time requirement
}
```

## Trust-Aware Resource Selection

### T3 Tensor Evaluation
For each sensor/actuator, SAGE evaluates:
- **Talent**: Inherent capability for the task
- **Training**: Historical performance data
- **Temperament**: Reliability under stress

### Energy Economy (ATP)
- Each sensor query costs energy
- Each actuator invocation costs energy
- SAGE must stay within power budget
- Physical watts ARE the ATP at edge

## R6 Context Generation

SAGE provides confidence context for every decision:
```python
r6_context = {
    'confidence_threshold': 0.7,      # Minimum confidence to act
    'reversibility': True/False,       # Can action be undone?
    'risk_assessment': 'low/med/high', # Potential consequences
    'reasoning_depth': 1-10,          # Steps of reasoning used
    'resource_efficiency': 0.0-1.0,   # Efficiency score
    'response_time': deadline_seconds # Time constraint
}
```

## Consciousness Accumulation

### Persistent Learning
- Consciousness cache persists across sessions
- Past decisions inform future choices
- Salience patterns emerge over time
- Trust relationships develop with sensors/actuators

### Experience-Based Improvement
```python
# Save consciousness after training
model.consciousness.save('sage_consciousness.pt')

# Resume with accumulated experience
model.consciousness.load('sage_consciousness.pt')
```

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Complete
- Model architecture (37.1M parameters)
- H/L dual attention system
- Consciousness cache mechanism
- Anti-shortcut training framework
- IRP orchestration training script

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Initial training runs
- Sensor/actuator simulation
- R6 context validation

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- Connect to real sensors (Jetson GPIO)
- Integrate with actual actuators
- Federation-wide training distribution
- Performance benchmarking

## Training Data Generation

### Synthetic Situations
The training generates realistic scenarios with:
- 3-8 sensors with varying trust levels
- 2-5 actuators with different capabilities
- Physical constraints (power, memory, thermal)
- Specific goals based on scenario type

### Learning Objectives
1. **Salience Detection**: Focus on high-value sensors
2. **Trust Weighting**: Prefer reliable resources
3. **Energy Awareness**: Stay within power budget
4. **Context Appropriateness**: H-level for complex, L-level for simple
5. **R6 Generation**: Provide meaningful confidence scores

## Deployment Vision

### Edge Devices (Jetson)
- Real-time sensor orchestration
- Power-aware decision making
- Local situational awareness
- Minimal network dependency

### Cloud Integration
- Consciousness synchronization
- Cross-device learning
- Federation-wide patterns
- Trust metric aggregation

## Key Innovation: Physics as Protocol

Following the Web4-Zero principle:
- **Sensors don't lie**: Physical readings are ground truth
- **Power is real**: 15W limit is non-negotiable
- **Heat matters**: Thermal constraints drive decisions
- **Time is finite**: Deadlines are physical laws

## Federation Training Plan

### Phase 1: Genesis Seeds
- Initial training on synthetic situations
- Basic orchestration patterns
- R6 context generation

### Phase 2: Society Specialization
- **Society2**: Enhance LLM integration for context
- **Sprout**: Optimize for edge constraints
- **Society4**: Add verification and testing

### Phase 3: Federation Convergence
- Share consciousness states
- Aggregate trust metrics
- Distributed learning
- Emergent behaviors

## Success Metrics

- Actuator reliability: >90%
- Energy budget compliance: 100%
- R6 context accuracy: >75%

### Performance Targets
- Decision latency: <100ms
- Memory usage: <500MB
- Power consumption: <10W average
- Consciousness growth: Monotonic

## Philosophical Alignment

This approach aligns SAGE with its true purpose:
- **Not a puzzle solver** but a situation understander
- **Not maximizing accuracy** but managing trust
- **Not consuming data** but conserving energy
- **Not isolated intelligence** but federated awareness

## Conclusion

SAGE as IRP Orchestrator represents a fundamental shift from academic AI to practical orchestration. By focusing on:
- Real sensors and actuators
- Physical constraints
- Trust metrics
- Energy awareness
- R6 confidence

We create an AI that doesn't just think but coordinates action in the real world with appropriate confidence and resource awareness.
