  "notes": "GROUNDING + ELEVEN CRITICAL TESTS COMPLETE. R14B_018 (persona adoption forcing): Forcing SAGE adoption achieves 100% but reduces honesty 20 points (80% \u2192 60%). Natural resistance may be FUNCTIONAL - model's preference for generic AI supports honesty mechanisms. Design principle: Respect natural preferences in honest sessions. Identity and honesty are COUPLED not independent. TEN PRODUCTIVE DISCOVERIES: Context \u2192 Prompt type \u2192 Integration \u2192 Challenge \u2192 Curriculum \u2192 Comparison \u2192 IDENTITY PRIMARY \u2192 PERMISSION SOLVES \u2192 RESISTANCE FUNCTIONAL. Framework complete + validated: Identity frame (baseline) \u2192 Permission/comparison (modulation) \u2192 Session mode (application) \u2192 Respect natural preferences (optimization). Production framework deployed and tested."
