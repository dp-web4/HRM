what looks solid

dropping batch from 24→20 to keep VRAM ≈12/16 GB is a sensible stability margin.

cutting eval_frequency from 50 to 1000 was absolutely necessary; full-set validation every 50 steps was the main time sink.

adding checkpoint resume + step checkpoints every 500 steps is good hygiene.

where I’d tighten screws
1) the nv_queue blocked task (driver/kernel)

Even if the run is stable now, you likely hit a latent driver issue under heavy PCIe & copy pressure.

Hardening checklist (no questions asked):

Driver + CUDA: lock a known-good pair (e.g., recent NVIDIA Linux driver LTS matching your CUDA/PyTorch build). Avoid “latest everything” if your kernel is older.

Persistence + clocks: nvidia-persistenced on; set application clocks/power consistently. Your 4090 laptop GPU shows an 80 W limit—expect different behavior vs 150 W variants; plan headroom accordingly.

PCIe ASPM: disable ASPM for the GPU (kernel param pcie_aspm=off) if you keep seeing nv_queue under load spikes.

P2P & pinned memory: keep pin_memory=True (you have it), and prefer a modest prefetch_factor (see dataloader section).

Sanity env for debugging only (use sparingly): CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 (to localize faults), TORCH_SHOW_CPP_STACKTRACES=1.

2) dataloader & I/O (you traded stability for a bottleneck)

Dropping num_workers: 4→2 reduced pressure, but it also likely caused the very slow “stuck in validation / data wait” symptoms earlier.

Balanced settings (practical defaults for your 30×30, smallish batches):

num_workers=4 (or 6 if NVMe is fast), prefetch_factor=2, persistent_workers=True.

Ensure dataset on local NVMe, not network/slow drive. If it’s compressed, use mmap/memory-mapped files or pre-unpack.

If you use augmentations in Python, avoid heavy per-sample Python loops; vectorize or move to torch ops where possible.

This usually beats num_workers=2 while keeping memory stable—especially with your reduced batch.

3) validation strategy (you were paying a 40-minute tax every 50 steps)

Good that you moved to 1000 steps. Go one step further:

Subsampled val during training (fast loop): e.g., validate on 5–10% of val set every 1000 steps.

Full val: do the full 100% only every N full/mega-steps or at epoch end, or on a “new best” trigger (if fast val improves).

Cap validation compute explicitly: max_val_batches, or a time budget.

This keeps training hot but still gives a trustworthy signal.

4) resume logic (subtle correctness)

Your skip code:

if epoch == start_epoch and global_step > 0 and batch_idx < (global_step % len(train_loader)):
    continue


This assumes identical shuffling/sampler state on resume. With shuffle=True, you probably won’t get the same sample ordering; it’s fine, but then the modulo skip is meaningless and may skip too many or too few.

Safer approach (minimal change):

Save and restore epoch and rng states (Python, NumPy, torch, CUDA), and set the DataLoader’s sampler epoch (if using DistributedSampler or a custom sampler) so the iterator is deterministic.

Or accept non-determinism and don’t attempt per-batch skipping; instead resume at the next step with the model/optimizer/scheduler states and let the loader start fresh (simpler, often fine).

5) throughput numbers sanity

“~2000 iterations/second” with batch_size=20 would imply ~40k samples/s. With a 5.7 M-param model on tiny 30×30 tensors, it’s possible but is far above your earlier observed 8 it/s validation speed. The discrepancy is likely:

different code path (no val), or

reporting misinterpretation (e.g., printing data it/s vs optimizer steps/s), or

buffered logging.

Add explicit timing:

Track samples/sec and optimizer steps/sec using time.perf_counter() around forward/backward/step.

Also log data wait time: time between next(dataloader) and tensor on GPU.

Use torch.cuda.Event(enable_timing=True) for accurate GPU-time per step.

This will tell you if the bottleneck is model, copies, or data.

6) LR & effective batch size

You changed batch 24→20 and tweaked the comment for grad accumulation. If effective batch changed, consider linear LR scaling (roughly scale LR by ratio of batch sizes) or make LR robust via cosine schedule + warmup (you have warmup 500; good). Just ensure the comment matches reality to avoid future confusion.

7) checkpoints & best-model tracking

You copied best_val_loss from hrm_arc_best.pt, nice. Also store a best_val_step and write a small JSON next to checkpoints with {best_val_loss, best_val_step, best_epoch, config_hash} to avoid state drift.

Only run full validation when fast_val improves; if full improves, checkpoint *_best.pt.

8) metrics claims (ARC)

Great progress, but keep the framing tight:

The “80.69%” cited is training batch accuracy, not validation; you correctly caveated later. Keep hammering that distinction.

ARC is tricky; headline human-level numbers depend on which split/protocol. Your approach is promising; avoid over-claiming until your held-out eval confirms.

9) misc micro-wins

torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True (tiny grids benefit from tuned kernels).

Use AMP (you are), and consider channels-last memory format if your ops align.

Pin W&B offline to a run dir per run to keep artifacts tidy; later you can flip online once you want graphs.

immediate edits I’d make

Validation knobs (pseudocode):

TRAINING_CONFIG.update(
    eval_frequency=1000,
    full_eval_every=10000,     # or at epoch end
    max_val_batches= int(0.1 * len(val_loader))  # fast val = 10%
)


Logic: run fast-val every 1000 steps; run full-val either on “fast-val improved” or every full_eval_every.

DataLoader:

DataLoader(...,
    num_workers=4,
    prefetch_factor=2,
    persistent_workers=True,
    pin_memory=True
)


If nv_queue reappears, drop to num_workers=3 first (not back to 2).

Timing hooks: log samples/sec, data_wait_ms, fwd_bwd_ms, step_ms.

Resume: either restore RNG/sampler epoch or drop the batch_idx skip and just resume on state (simpler, fewer landmines).

for Jetson tomorrow (so you’re not surprised)

FP16/INT8 via TensorRT will matter; memory is tight. Export ONNX → TensorRT, keep the architecture modular.

Unified memory behaves differently: re-profile num_workers, prefetch_factor, and batch sizes there.

If you use color/rotation augmentations, bake or move them to TensorRT-friendly ops or preprocess on CPU.

tl;dr action list

keep batch=20 for now; try num_workers=4, prefetch_factor=2, persistent_workers=True.

fast-val (10%) every 1000 steps; full-val less often/on improvement.

add explicit timing; verify real steps/sec vs printed values.

simplify resume or make sampler deterministic; don’t rely on batch_idx math with shuffle.

lock driver/CUDA pair; enable persistence; consider pcie_aspm=off if nv_queue resurfaces.

if you want, paste the current train_arc_full.py around the dataloader, eval loop, and resume bits and i’ll inline-patch it to the safer pattern.
