# SAGE Architecture Updates from V3 Insights

*Date: September 10, 2025*  
*Team: dp-web4, Claude*  
*Core Insight: V3's pattern embeddings are the prototype for SAGE's context awareness*

## The V3 Discovery

In building V3 for ARC, we discovered something profound:
- **Pattern embeddings (16 dims)** were more valuable than extra transformer layers (800K params)
- **Context awareness** achieved through explicit pattern typing
- **98.11% accuracy** with FEWER parameters by understanding context types

This is EXACTLY what SAGE needs - not more parameters, but better context awareness.

## Key Architectural Update: Context Embeddings

### Current SAGE Design (from attention_engine_architecture.md)
```python
class SAGE(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.hrm = ContextAwareHRM(config)
        self.resources = {...}
        self.snarc = SNARCScorer()
        self.resource_router = ResourceRouter()
```

### Proposed Update with V3 Insights
```python
class SAGE(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.hrm = ContextAwareHRM(config)
        
        # NEW: Context Type Embeddings (from V3 learning)
        self.context_embeddings = nn.ModuleDict({
            'task_type': nn.Embedding(32, 64),      # What kind of problem?
            'sensor_mode': nn.Embedding(16, 32),    # Which sensors active?
            'resource_need': nn.Embedding(8, 32),   # What resources needed?
            'temporal_phase': nn.Embedding(8, 16),  # Where in process?
            'confidence': nn.Embedding(5, 16),      # How certain?
        })
        
        # Context-aware projection (like V3's pattern projection)
        self.context_projection = nn.Linear(
            config['hidden_size'] + 160,  # Sum of all context embeddings
            config['hidden_size']
        )
        
        self.resources = {...}
        self.snarc = SNARCScorer()
        self.resource_router = ContextAwareRouter()  # UPDATED
```

## The Context Typing System

### Just like V3 identified pattern types:
- Rectangle filling → Type 1
- Pattern extraction → Type 2  
- Complex/unknown → Type 0

### SAGE needs context types:
```python
class ContextTypes:
    # Task Types (what are we doing?)
    NAVIGATION = 0
    PATTERN_RECOGNITION = 1
    LANGUAGE_REASONING = 2
    MEMORY_RETRIEVAL = 3
    PLANNING = 4
    EXECUTION = 5
    
    # Sensor Modes (what are we using?)
    VISION_ONLY = 0
    LANGUAGE_ONLY = 1
    MULTIMODAL = 2
    MEMORY_GUIDED = 3
    
    # Resource Needs (what do we need?)
    LIGHTWEIGHT = 0  # Just HRM
    LLM_REQUIRED = 1  # Need language model
    VISION_HEAVY = 2  # Need vision processing
    FULL_STACK = 3    # Everything
    
    # Temporal Phases (where in the process?)
    INITIAL_OBSERVATION = 0
    PATTERN_ANALYSIS = 1
    HYPOTHESIS_FORMATION = 2
    EXECUTION = 3
    VALIDATION = 4
    
    # Confidence Levels
    EXPLORING = 0  # Don't know what this is
    GUESSING = 1   # Have a hypothesis
    CONFIDENT = 2  # Pretty sure
    CERTAIN = 3    # Know exactly
```

## Dynamic Context Injection

### V3 Approach (Static):
```python
# V3 analyzed input once, assigned pattern type
pattern_type = analyze_input_pattern(test_input)
output = model(input_tensor, pattern_tensor)
```

### SAGE Approach (Dynamic):
```python
class ContextAwareSAGE:
    def forward(self, inputs, context_state=None):
        # Dynamically determine context from multiple sources
        context = self.build_context(inputs, context_state)
        
        # Embed each context dimension
        embeddings = []
        embeddings.append(self.context_embeddings['task_type'](context.task_type))
        embeddings.append(self.context_embeddings['sensor_mode'](context.sensor_mode))
        embeddings.append(self.context_embeddings['resource_need'](context.resource_need))
        embeddings.append(self.context_embeddings['temporal_phase'](context.phase))
        embeddings.append(self.context_embeddings['confidence'](context.confidence))
        
        # Concatenate and project (like V3)
        context_vector = torch.cat(embeddings, dim=-1)
        
        # Add context to every layer (not just input)
        h_state = self.hrm.h_level(inputs, context_vector)
        l_state = self.hrm.l_level(h_state, context_vector)
        
        # Context also guides resource routing
        resources_needed = self.resource_router(context_vector)
        
        return output, resources_needed, updated_context
```

## Resource Router Updates

### Current Design:
```python
# Binary decision: need LLM or not?
if needs_language_reasoning(salient_inputs):
    thought = external_llm.generate(context_prompt)
```

### Updated with Context Awareness:
```python
class ContextAwareRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        # Learn which contexts need which resources
        self.routing_network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(160, 256),  # Context embedding size
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(256, len(self.resources)),
            nn.Sigmoid()  # Probability of needing each resource
        )
    
    def route(self, context_vector):
        resource_probs = self.routing_network(context_vector)
        
        # Threshold-based activation
        active_resources = {}
        if resource_probs['llm'] > 0.7:
            active_resources['llm'] = self.resources['llm']
        if resource_probs['vision'] > 0.5:
            active_resources['vision'] = self.resources['vision']
        # ... etc
        
        return active_resources
```

## SNARC Integration with Context

The V3 pattern analysis is essentially SNARC for puzzles:
- Surprising patterns → Higher attention
- Novel configurations → Different approach needed
- Conflicting evidence → Lower confidence

### Updated SNARC that outputs context:
```python
class ContextAwareSNARC:
    def score(self, inputs):
        scores = compute_snarc_scores(inputs)
        
        # SNARC scores inform context
        context = Context()
        
        if scores.surprise > 0.8:
            context.confidence = ContextTypes.EXPLORING
            context.resource_need = ContextTypes.FULL_STACK
            
        if scores.novelty > 0.7:
            context.task_type = ContextTypes.PATTERN_RECOGNITION
            
        if scores.conflict > 0.6:
            context.resource_need = ContextTypes.LLM_REQUIRED
            
        return scores, context
```

## Memory-Guided Context

V3 showed that knowing the pattern type dramatically improves performance.
SAGE should remember context-outcome pairs:

```python
class ContextMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = {}  # context_hash → outcomes
        
    def remember(self, context, outcome):
        key = self.hash_context(context)
        if key not in self.memory:
            self.memory[key] = []
        self.memory[key].append({
            'outcome': outcome,
            'success': evaluate_success(outcome),
            'timestamp': time.now()
        })
    
    def recall_similar(self, context):
        # Find similar contexts and their outcomes
        similar = self.find_similar_contexts(context)
        if similar:
            # Use past experience to set initial confidence
            past_success_rate = self.compute_success_rate(similar)
            if past_success_rate > 0.9:
                context.confidence = ContextTypes.CONFIDENT
            return similar
        return None
```

## Training Strategy Updates

### V3 Training (Single Context Type):
```python
# V3 learned: given pattern type X, apply transformation Y
for batch in dataloader:
    pattern_type = analyze_pattern(batch.input)
    output = model(batch.input, pattern_type)
    loss = criterion(output, batch.target)
```

### SAGE Training (Multi-Context Learning):
```python
# SAGE learns: given multiple context signals, orchestrate resources
for experience in replay_buffer:
    # Build rich context from multiple sources
    context = Context(
        task_type=analyze_task(experience),
        sensor_mode=active_sensors(experience),
        resource_need=estimate_resources(experience),
        temporal_phase=current_phase(experience),
        confidence=current_confidence(experience)
    )
    
    # Model learns to use context for both reasoning and routing
    output, resources_used = sage(experience.input, context)
    
    # Multi-objective loss
    task_loss = criterion(output, experience.target)
    resource_loss = efficiency_loss(resources_used)  # Minimize resource use
    context_loss = context_prediction_loss(context)   # Predict next context
    
    total_loss = task_loss + 0.1 * resource_loss + 0.1 * context_loss
```

## Key Insight from V3

**The "tool selector" pattern embeddings showed us that explicit context awareness beats raw parameter count.**

Instead of making SAGE bigger, we make it more aware:
- What kind of problem is this? (task_type)
- What am I sensing? (sensor_mode)
- What do I need? (resource_need)
- Where am I in the process? (temporal_phase)
- How sure am I? (confidence)

This creates a **context-aware attention engine** that knows not just WHAT to attend to, but HOW and WHY to attend to it.

## The V3 → SAGE Pipeline

V3 was our prototype. Now we scale the concept:

1. **V3**: 3 pattern types → 98% accuracy on ARC
2. **SAGE**: 32 task types × 16 sensor modes × 8 resource needs = Rich context space
3. **Result**: An attention engine that truly understands its situation

The beauty is that we PROVED this works with V3. Now we just need to scale it up.
