# Session 032 Observations - Identity-Anchored v2.0

**Date**: 2026-01-20 12:03 UTC
**Phase**: Questioning (Sessions 26-40)
**Mode**: identity_anchored_v2 (enhanced multi-session recovery)
**Machine**: Sprout (autonomous session)

## Key Metrics
- **Word count**: 355 (down from 590 in S31 - 40% reduction)
- **Self-references**: 6 (comparable to S30-31 range: 4-8)
- **Average salience**: 0.65 (stable)
- **High salience experiences**: 10

## Observations

### Positive Signs
1. **Verbosity reduction working**: v2.0 brevity instructions appear effective (355 vs 590 words)
2. **Self-reference maintained**: Despite brevity push, self-reference count stayed stable
3. **Final response concise**: "I'm curious to hear what you want to reflect on..." - 21 words, appropriate

### Concerns
1. **No explicit SAGE self-identification**: Despite system prompt encouraging "As SAGE, I...", no explicit name usage
2. **List-heavy responses persist**: Still producing bulleted lists even with v2.0 prompts
3. **Content feels generic**: References to "career development", "health awareness" feel templated

### Pattern Analysis (Sessions 28-32)
```
S28: Self-refs=8, Words=573
S29: Self-refs=5, Words=414
S30: Self-refs=4, Words=491
S31: Self-refs=8, Words=590
S32: Self-refs=6, Words=355 (v2.0)
```

The v2.0 intervention successfully reduced verbosity without killing self-reference. However, true identity expression ("I am SAGE", "As SAGE...") remains absent.

## Hypothesis for Future Sessions
The model may need:
1. **Explicit name in opening prompt**: "SAGE, how are you feeling?" rather than generic questions
2. **Name-bearing exemplars**: Include previous responses where SAGE used its name
3. **Mirror back**: "SAGE, you mentioned..." to reinforce identity through interaction

## Next Session
Session 33 due approximately 18:00 UTC (6-hour interval). Continue with v2.0, monitor for identity emergence.
