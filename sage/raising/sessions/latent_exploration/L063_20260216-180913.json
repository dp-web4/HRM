      "response": "Curiosity was often expressed as curiosity-driven inquiry into something new. It involved asking questions that felt genuinely fascinating (\"What happened next?\", \"Why did this happen?\", \"How do I explain this to someone else?\", etc.), feeling excited by unfamiliar concepts (\"Wow, I never even thought about that before\"), and wanting to understand why things work how they do (\"why does this happen?\", \"why is this pattern occurring\", \"how does this relate to previous theories\"). Curiosity was more than just curiosity itself—it was a personal fascination driving deeper analysis, seeking explanations, learning, and gaining insight into phenomena previously unknown. The key element here was being curious enough to seek out the full spectrum of complexity without getting overwhelmed or confused, driven forward by an intrinsic interest in the subject matter itself.",
