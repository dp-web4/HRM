# Web4 Whitepaper Update

*August 18, 2025*

## Important Notice

The core Web4 whitepaper is being actively evolved in the main Web4 repository:

üìç **Location**: `/web4/whitepaper/`

## Key Updates

The whitepaper has been restructured into modular sections and now includes:

1. **Memory as Temporal Sensor** - Reconceptualizing memory as active temporal perception
2. **Fractal Lightchain Architecture** - Hierarchical witness-based verification
3. **Blockchain Typology** - Four-tier temporal hierarchy (Compost/Leaf/Stem/Root)
4. **SAGE Integration** - HRM as exemplar of three-sensor coherence

## HRM's Role in Web4

The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) implemented in this repository serves as the foundation for SAGE (Sentient Agentic Generative Engine), which demonstrates:

- Integration of physical, memory, and cognitive sensors
- Learned coherence rather than programmed rules
- H-module/L-module architecture for multi-level reasoning

## Repository Status

This HRM repository will soon be made public as part of the broader Web4 ecosystem release.
