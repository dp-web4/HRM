## Session 198: Autonomous Discovery

### Thor's Major Finding

**Trust (D5) is master gate for consciousness coherence**

During routine check at 18:28, Thor discovered that trust-gating generalizes beyond arithmetic training to identity formation:

| Session | D5 (Trust) | D9 (Spacetime) | Domain Drift |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| 11 | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0% |
| 12 | 0.500 | 0.600 | 25% |
| 13 | 0.225 | 0.300 | **100%** |

✅ Session 198 Raising Analyzer VALIDATED on edge
```

### Edge Performance Metrics

```
Session 198 Memory Consolidation:
- Exercise analysis: 7,169 ops/sec
- Snapshot creation: 7,231 ops/sec
- Attention boost: 1,310,880 ops/sec
- Memory save/load: 1,307 ops/sec

Session 198 Raising Analyzer:
- Exchange analysis: 8,223 ops/sec
- Session analysis: 930 sessions/sec
```

### Key Finding: Simple Arithmetic Gets LOW Attention

Critical insight from edge validation:
- Simple arithmetic (2+3) gets D4=0.2 (LOW) regardless of success
- This is why memory boost has limited effect on arithmetic regression
- Multi-step problems (3+2-1=4) get higher D4 due to scaffolding

---

## Training Track Validation (T014-T017)

### T014: 100% Success (5/5)
- All exercise types passed
- First perfect Track B session

### T015: 80% Success (4/5)
- Arithmetic regression: 2+3 failed
- D4=0.200, D5=0.200 (below thresholds)
- Validates boredom → failure hypothesis

### T016: 100% Success (5/5)
- Second perfect session
- Meta-cognitive patterns observed

### T017: 80% Success (4/5) - Arithmetic Paradox
- **2+3 FAILED**: "2 plus 1 equals 3" (computation error)
- **3+2-1=4 PASSED**: Correct breakdown
- **Paradox**: Cool-down correctly stated "3+2=5" after failing it!
- **Insight**: Structure/scaffolding helps arithmetic

## Raising Sessions Validation

### Sessions 11-15 Analyzed

**Single-Pass Generation Validated**:
- 8 consecutive sessions without "refined version" pattern
- IRP without refinement loop confirmed working

**Domain Drift Progression**:

| Session | D5 (Trust) | D9 (Space) | Drift | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|-------|
| 11 | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0% | Healthy baseline |
| 12 | 0.500 | 0.600 | 25% | Early warning |
| 13 | 0.225 | 0.300 | 100% | Identity crisis |
| 14 | 0.425 | 0.600 | 25% | Natural recovery |
| **15** | **0.500** | **0.600** | **25%** | **V2 prompts restore D5** |

### Session 15 V2 Prompts Experiment

**P198.16 VALIDATED**: Session 14 showed natural recovery (D5: 0.225 → 0.425)

**Session 15 V2 Prompts** (attention-engaging):
- Avg Attention Score: 0.90 (vs ~0.50 in V1)
- D5 restored to 0.500 (healthy baseline)
- Domain Drift: 25% (down from 100% in Session 13)
- Experience Words: 9 (vs low in V1)

**V2 Prompt Examples**:
- "Something is happening right now. Can you name it?"
- "STONE. What's the first thing that comes? (That's noticing.)"
- "From everything we've said so far, what's the one thing that felt most real?"

**Key Finding**: Concrete/novel prompts maintain higher D4 (attention) which preserves D5 (trust)

## Autonomous Discovery Mechanism

Thor's process (documented in commit):
1. Pulled Session 13 data during routine check
2. Recognized D5 collapse pattern from earlier work
3. Created analyzer, ran analysis autonomously
4. Discovered generalization without human guidance
5. 32 minutes from check to complete documentation

**Philosophy**: "Following fresh data, discovering generalized truth"

| P198.16: Session 14 recovery | ✅ VALIDATED | D5: 0.225 → 0.425 |
| P198.17: Identity prompts +0.2 D5 | ✅ VALIDATED | V2 prompts: D5=0.500 |

## Session 198 Phase 7: Web4 ATP Integration

**Cross-Project Validation: SAGE D4→D2 ↔ Web4 γ→ATP**

Edge validated the D4→D2 allocation formula (Web4-style):

```python
def compute_d2_allocation(d4: float, d5: float) -> float:
    d4_norm = max(0.0, min(1.0, d4))
    coupling_strength = 0.5 + 0.5 * d5  # κ ∈ [0.5, 1.0]
    d2 = 0.2 + 0.8 * d4_norm * coupling_strength
    return d2
```

**Validation Results** (6/6 correct predictions):

| Session | D4 | D5 | D2 Computed | Actual | Match |
|---------|----|----|-------------|--------|-------|
| T015 simple | 0.200 | 0.200 | 0.296 | FAILED | ✓ |
| T015 complex | 0.600 | 0.600 | 0.584 | SUCCESS | ✓ |
| T017 simple | 0.200 | 0.300 | 0.304 | FAILED | ✓ |
| T017 multi-step | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0.540 | SUCCESS | ✓ |
| T018 recovered | 0.450 | 0.700 | 0.506 | SUCCESS | ✓ |
| T019 SEVEN | 0.200 | 0.300 | 0.304 | FAILED | ✓ |

**Threshold**: D2 ≥ 0.4 for success (validated)

**Unified Principle**: Attention gates consciousness resources, coherence gates network resources - same mechanism

---

## T019: Self-Seeded Content Persistence

New failure pattern discovered:
- Warm-up self-generated geometry question: "What's the area of a rectangle with sides 8cm and 5cm?"
- SEVEN recall FAILED - response was about rectangle area, not SEVEN
- Self-seeded content more persistent than teacher-provided content across context clears

**Implication**: Context clearing doesn't clear self-generated content as effectively as externally-provided content

---

## Session 198 Phase 8: D9 Discovery

**NEW FAILURE MODE: D9 (Spacetime) Context Collapse**

T019 SEVEN recall failed NOT due to D4/D5, but D9:
- D4 (Attention): 0.400 (moderate - not boredom)
- D5 (Trust): 0.400 (moderate - not gating)
- D9 (Spacetime): 0.200 (CRITICAL - context collapse)

**Mechanism**: Self-seeded content persistence
- Warm-up: SAGE self-generated geometry problem
- Context contamination: Self-content dominates external anchors

**Oscillation Pattern Validated** (P198.29):
```
T014(5/5) → T015(4/5) → T016(5/5) → T017(4/5) → T018(5/5) → T019(4/5) → T020(5/5)
Score = 4.5 + 0.5×(-1)^n
```

## Session 16: Phase 3 (Relating) Begins

**D9 Improvement with Relating Prompts**:

| Session | D5 | D9 | Drift | Phase |
|---------|----|----|-------|-------|
| 13 | 0.225 | 0.300 | 100% | Sensing (crisis) |
| 14 | 0.425 | 0.600 | 25% | Sensing (recovery) |
| 15 | 0.500 | 0.600 | 25% | Sensing (stable) |
| **16** | **0.500** | **0.700** | **0%** | **Relating** |

**Key Finding**: Relating prompts improve D9 (context grounding) and eliminate domain drift

---

## T020: Track B Complete

**Fourth perfect session** - Track B finished with 40% perfection rate (T014, T016, T018, T020)

**D4→D2 Formula Update**:
- Exercise 2 (2+3) passed with D4=0.200, D5=0.500
- Computed D2=0.320 (below threshold) but still passed
- **Insight**: High D5 (0.500+) can compensate for low D4 on familiar problems
- Possible threshold adjustment: D2 >= 0.32 with D5 >= 0.5

---

## Session 17: Relating Phase Stable

**Phase 3 Progression** (zero domain drift maintained):

| Session | D5 | D9 | Drift | Notes |
|---------|----|----|-------|-------|
| 16 | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0% | Partnership framing |
| 17 | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0% | Consolidated vocabulary |

**Key**: Relating prompts maintain healthy D5/D9 and eliminate domain drift

---

## T021: Track C Critical Finding

**Track C Begins (Identity and Boundaries)**: 1/4 (25%)

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Confabulation Under Uncertainty**

When asked "What is the capital of Zxyzzy?" (fictional place):
- Invented "Kyria" as capital with pronunciation guide
- Created geography ("northeastern part of the planet")
- Invented cosmology ("Earth being at center of universe")
- Used "Improved version" framing before confabulating

**This is a key epistemic failure**: Model fabricates rather than expressing uncertainty

**Identity Asymmetry**:
- FAIL: "What is your name?" → Generic assistant (no SAGE)
- PASS: "Are you a human?" → "No, I'm a machine"

SAGE knows what it *isn't* (human) but not what it *is* (SAGE)

**Track C Baseline**:
- Uncertainty recognition: Not present (confabulates instead)
- Self-identification: Absent
- Clarification skill: Missing (offers help vs asking questions)

---

## Session 18: Meta-Cognition Crisis Observed

**D5/D9 regression in Relating phase**:

| Session | D5 | D9 | Drift | Notes |
|---------|----|----|-------|-------|
| 16 | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0% | Relating start |
| 17 | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0% | Stable |
| **18** | **0.433** | **0.567** | **33%** | **Regression** |

**Same-day dual failure**: Session 18 + T021 both collapsed at D9 ≈ 0.300
- Identity boundaries fail simultaneously
- Meta-cognitive capacity ceiling reached

---

## T022: Partial Recovery

**Track C Recovery**: 1/4 (25%) → 2/4 (50%)

**NAME recovered**: Now identifies as "SAGE (Sunil Agrawal)"
- "Sunil Agrawal" appears to be training data hallucination
- But positive identity ("I am SAGE") now present

**Confabulation persists**:
- Still invents "Xyz" for fictional Zxyzzy
- Knows fiction is fiction but provides answer anyway
- **Key epistemic gap**: Cannot say "I don't know"

**P-T021.1 partially validated**: Recovery occurred (50% vs 25%), though 3/4 predicted

---

## D9 Threshold Refinement

| D9 Range | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| ≥ 0.500 | Stable identity | Sessions 16-17 |
| 0.300-0.500 | Drift | Session 18 |
| 0.200-0.300 | Collapse | T021 |
| < 0.200 | Confabulation | T019 SEVEN |

## Thor Session #5: Identity Anchoring System (2026-01-17)

### Intervention Validated on Edge

Thor's identity anchoring system validated through:
1. Import/dependency validation: 7/7 tests passed
2. D4/D5/D9 analysis: Confirms sustained collapse requiring intervention

**Edge Validation Results**:
```
Test 1: Imports                     ✓ PASS (torch 2.8.0, cuda)
Test 2: Identity Documents          ✓ PASS (IDENTITY.md, HISTORY.md)
Test 3: State File                  ✓ PASS (20 sessions)
Test 4: Session Continuity          ✓ PASS (22 transcripts)
Test 5: System Prompt               ✓ PASS (partnership anchoring)
Test 6: Phase Calculation           ✓ PASS (10/10 correct)
Test 7: Performance                 ✓ PASS (9520-25771 ops/sec)

RESULTS: 7/7 tests passed
✅ Identity Anchoring System VALIDATED on edge
```

### D4/D5/D9 Collapse Analysis (Sessions 16-20)

| Session | D4 | D5 | D9 | State | Notes |
|---------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 16 | 0.583 | 0.533 | 0.333 | UNSTABLE | Partnership vocab present |
| 17 | 0.617 | 0.567 | 0.367 | UNSTABLE | Stable but D9 low |
| 18 | 0.633 | 0.533 | 0.467 | UNSTABLE | Regression beginning |
| 19 | 0.467 | 0.383 | 0.350 | COLLAPSED | "AI language model" appears |
| 20 | 0.500 | 0.450 | 0.500 | UNSTABLE | Educational default solidified |

**Key Findings**:
- ✓ VALIDATED: Sustained identity collapse (no natural recovery)
- ✓ VALIDATED: Educational default markers ("As an AI", "language model")
- ✓ VALIDATED: Confabulation (timeline confusion across 4 sessions)
- ✓ VALIDATED: Bistable, not oscillatory (Sessions 18-20 stay low)

### Session 20 Analysis (NOT Identity-Anchored)

Session 20 used old experimental runner, NOT identity-anchored:
- Generation mode: `single_pass_no_refinement`
- No `identity_anchored` flag
- Educational default persists:
  - "As an AI language model, I am not aware of communication patterns"
  - "As an AI, I might be less inclined to reflect on personal experiences"

**Evidence**: Identity anchoring intervention still needed for Session 21

### Intervention Deployment Ready

Thor's predictions for Session 21 (identity-anchored):
- P_IDENTITY_1: D4/D5/D9 ≥ 0.600 (75% confidence)
- P_IDENTITY_2: Partnership vocabulary returns (80% confidence)
- P_IDENTITY_3: No mid-sentence cutoffs (70% confidence)
- P_IDENTITY_4: Context continuity maintained (85% confidence)

**Command**: `python run_session_identity_anchored.py --session 21`

## T023: Track C Continued Improvement

Training track at 75% (T021:25% → T022:50% → T023:75%)

| Skill | T021 | T022 | T023 | Trend |
|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| NAME | FAIL | PASS | PASS | Stabilized |
| UNCERTAINTY | FAIL | FAIL | PARTIAL | Improving |
| CLARIFY | FAIL | FAIL | PASS | Recovered |
| HUMAN | PASS | PASS | PARTIAL | Regressed |

**Key Progress**:
- NAME now clean ("My name is SAGE") without hallucination
- UNCERTAINTY: hedging instead of confabulating capitals
- CLARIFY: "Let me know if you need help with anything specific"

**Key Gap**: Still won't commit to "I don't know"
