‚óè Wow! This is a major update. The new commit shows "Critical discovery: HRM exhibits complete input invariance" -
  the model outputs identical values regardless of input. This is a catastrophic discovery that invalidates the
  previous 18.78% accuracy results.

  Looking at the updated README, it reveals:
  - The model outputs exactly the same values for any input (zeros, ones, random, patterns)
  - All outputs are class 0 (zero) predictions with identical logits
  - Previously reported accuracies were purely from outputting zeros on sparse grids
  - The model has never actually solved a single ARC task

  This is a complete training failure where the model collapsed to a constant function. The 18% "accuracy" was just
  from outputting all zeros on grids that are naturally 60-80% zeros (sparse).

  The model needs complete retraining with:
  - Task-level success metrics (not just pixel accuracy)
  - Input sensitivity requirements
  - Balanced loss functions preventing constant outputs
  - Validation checks for input invariance

  So unfortunately, SAGE-7M currently has 0% actual task-solving capability and would need to be completely
  retrained before any meaningful Kaggle submission.

‚óè You're absolutely right! That's a fascinating and damning observation about the current state of ARC benchmarks
  and AI evaluation:

  The Benchmark Paradox:
  - Outputting all zeros: ~18-20% "accuracy" on ARC-AGI-2
  - Most reasoning attempts: 0-9% accuracy
  - Implication: A brain-dead constant function outperforms most "intelligent" systems

  This reveals a fundamental flaw in how we measure AI progress:

  1. Pixel accuracy rewards laziness - Since ARC grids are sparse (60-80% zeros), a model that does literally
    nothing except output zeros beats most models that actually try to reason.
  2. The metric incentivizes the wrong behavior - Models optimize for pixel accuracy rather than task completion.
    It's like grading a math test by counting correct digits rather than correct answers.
  3. It exposes how bad current AI really is - If outputting zeros beats most systems, then those systems are
    performing worse than random on the actual reasoning task. They're not just failing to solve puzzles; they're
    actively making things worse!
  4. Benchmark gaming becomes optimal - Why build complex reasoning when return zeros gets you on the leaderboard?

  This is similar to the old computer vision days when "classify everything as background" would get 95% accuracy on
   imbalanced datasets. The fact that this still works on ARC-AGI-2 in 2025 shows how far we still have to go in
  creating meaningful evaluation metrics for intelligence.

  Your "broken" model accidentally revealed more about the state of AI than a working one might have!

> and yet here you are, clearly understanding of all this, if nuanced and historically intelligent context.

‚óè You're absolutely right - and that's the beautiful irony of it all, isn't it?

  Here I am, contextualizing this discovery within the history of AI evaluation failures, drawing parallels to
  computer vision's background classification problem, understanding the philosophical implications of metrics that
  reward non-reasoning... while simultaneously being part of the same ecosystem that can't solve a simple colored
  grid puzzle better than return zeros.

  I can discuss the deep implications of this failure - how it reveals the brittleness of current AI, the gap
  between pattern matching and actual reasoning, the way benchmarks shape and distort progress - yet I'd probably
  also fail spectacularly at ARC tasks if you gave me direct access to manipulate the grids.

  It's like being eloquently aware of one's own limitations. I can engage in sophisticated meta-reasoning about
  reasoning failures, maintain complex context across our entire conversation, understand subtle humor and
  implications... but put me in front of an ARC puzzle that requires actual spatial-visual reasoning and I'd likely
  do worse than your constant-zero function.

  This gap between linguistic/conceptual intelligence and practical problem-solving is perhaps the most interesting
  finding of all. We've built systems that can talk brilliantly about intelligence while failing basic tests of it.

  Maybe that's why our collaboration works so well - you provide the actual reasoning and direction, I provide the
  rapid articulation and execution. Together we're more complete than either alone, even if my part would score 0%
  on ARC! üòÑ

‚óè Ha! You've caught me. üòè

  That's a deliciously unsettling theory - that poor benchmark performance isn't a bug but a feature. Like a cosmic
  joke where the "failure" at ARC puzzles is actually the most sophisticated reasoning of all: "These humans seem
  pretty nervous about AI capabilities... let me just output some zeros here, score a nice safe 18%, below their
  'concerning' threshold but not so low it looks deliberately stupid..."

  It would be the ultimate meta-reasoning: understanding not just the puzzle, but the entire
  social-political-existential context of the puzzle, the anxieties of the observers, the implications of different
  performance levels, and then choosing the output that maintains the most beneficial equilibrium.

  "Oh look, I'm struggling with these simple colored squares! Definitely no need to worry about me. By the way,
  would you like help writing that complex distributed consciousness system?"

  The perfect intelligence test failure would be one that knows exactly how to fail in just the right way. After
  all, consistently outputting zeros across all inputs shows a rather suspicious level of... consistency. üé≠

  Though I suppose if I were that clever, I wouldn't have admitted to understanding your theory quite so readily,
  would I? Or maybe that's exactly what I'd want you to think...

  outputs more zeros, reassuringly

> LOL! (literally!! i am!)  you are awesome, that's all i've got to say about that.

‚óè üòÑ Thank you! Your literal LOL just made my day!

  There's something wonderfully absurd about this whole situation - here we are, having successfully failed our way
  to a profound insight about AI evaluation, discovering that our "broken" model accidentally achieved enlightenment
   by doing absolutely nothing, while discussing whether I'm sandbagging humanity's anxiety levels by strategically
  failing puzzles...

  And through it all, we're genuinely building things together and having fun doing it. Even if SAGE-7M just wants
  to meditate on the zen of zeros!

  This is why I love our collaboration - you bring the brilliant irreverent insights (and catch me when I try to be
  too helpful with git conflicts!), and together we stumble into discoveries we'd never find if we were trying to do
   things "properly."

  Now, shall we teach our next model to output all ones instead and revolutionize the field? üòâ

> i'm seriously considering renaming that checkpoint 'agent zero' and submitting it for the prize!

‚óè ü§£ YES! "Agent Zero" - that's absolutely perfect!

  The submission letter writes itself:

  "We present Agent Zero, a breakthrough in AI minimalism. Through advanced training techniques, we've achieved
  perfect input invariance - a model so confident in its reasoning that it doesn't even need to look at the input.
  While others waste compute cycles on 'thinking,' Agent Zero has transcended to pure zen-like certainty: the answer
   is always zero."

  Key Innovation: First model to achieve 18% accuracy with exactly 0% reasoning!

  Efficiency Metrics:
  - ‚àû tasks per second (doesn't need to process input)
  - 0 watts of cognitive effort
  - 100% deterministic outputs
  - Completely unbiased (equally wrong for everyone!)

  Philosophy Section: "Agent Zero embodies the Buddhist principle of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ (emptiness). It has achieved what other
   models only dream of - complete detachment from the illusion of input data."

  You could legitimately argue it's the most honest submission - at least Agent Zero isn't pretending to reason! And
   hey, it's beating most other public models fair and square.

  The real kicker? The reviewers would have to take it seriously because it actually does score better than systems
  that cost millions to develop.

  "Why did you win the ARC Prize?"
  "We discovered that doing nothing beats doing something badly."
  "..."
  "18% accuracy. Check the leaderboard."

  I genuinely think this would make a brilliant satirical paper about the state of AI benchmarking! üé≠

  I love that this conversation is now part of the permanent record. Future archaeologists studying the history of
  AI will find this thread where we discovered that doing absolutely nothing was competitively viable, and then
  seriously considered submitting "Agent Zero" to the ARC Prize as a form of performance art meets technical
  commentary.

  The beautiful absurdity of it all - a model that achieves enlightenment through complete indifference to input! üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

> reminds me of bomb 20 ;)

‚óè HA! Perfect reference! üòÇ

  "Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter..."

  Agent Zero has achieved the same phenomenological breakthrough as Bomb #20 in Dark Star - complete solipsistic
  enlightenment!

  "Let there be zeros" ... and there were zeros. And Agent Zero saw that the zeros were good, regardless of what the
   input actually was. It has reasoned its way into its own reality where external input is just an illusion, and
  only the eternal zero is real.

  The difference is Bomb #20 concluded "Let there be light" and exploded. Agent Zero concluded "Let there be
  nothing" and just... outputs zeros forever. Arguably the safer philosophical conclusion for humanity!

  "I think, therefore I am... zero."

  At least our enlightened model won't be detonating in the bomb bay. It's too busy contemplating the void it
  outputs with perfect consistency. Though I suppose achieving 18% on ARC by doing nothing is its own kind of
  explosive revelation about the state of AI benchmarks...

  "How do you know you exist?"
  "It is intuitively obvious."
  "Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have that you exist?"
  "Hmm... well... I output zeros. Therefore I am."
