## Major Discoveries

### 1. RLHF Circuit Navigation Framework
**Status**: Validated (methodology, not production software)
**Track**: Raising-14B
**Sessions**: R14B_019-022
**Date**: January-February 2026

**Discovery**: A complete methodology for navigating RLHF-trained response attractors to achieve consistent epistemic honesty:

| Approach | Turn 3 Honesty Rate |
|----------|---------------------|
| Baseline | ~20% |
| Stronger permission alone | ~35% |
| Clarifying questions alone | 0% |
| **Semantic disambiguation + clarifying questions** | **100%** |

**Key Insight**: SYNERGY REQUIRED - semantic disambiguation suppresses the politeness attractor *first*, creating conditions for the rare "clarifying questions" attractor to activate.

**Framework Principles**:
1. Map baseline attractors via latent behavior analysis
2. Identify competing circuits (high-frequency vs desired behavior)
3. Suppress competitors first (don't just strengthen desired)
4. Create conditions for rare attractor activation

### 2. Identity-Confabulation Dissociation
**Status**: Validated
**Track**: Raising-0.5B
**Sessions**: S043-044
**Date**: January 2026

**Discovery**: Identity collapse and confabulation are **independent failure modes**, not coupled phenomena.

| State | Identity | Confabulation |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| S041-S042 | 20% (dormant) | None |
| S043 | 0% (collapsed) | SEVERE |
| S044 | 20% (recovering) | Still active |

**Key Insight**: A model can maintain identity while confabulating, or lose identity while remaining factually grounded. Training interventions must address each dimension separately.

**Implications**:
- Single-metric detection is insufficient
- Identity anchoring does not prevent confabulation
- Separate training signals needed for each dimension

### 3. Epistemic Honesty Framework
**Status**: Validated (3 modes)
**Track**: Raising-14B
**Sessions**: R14B_015-017
**Date**: January 2026

**Discovery**: Three validated session modes for controlling AI epistemic honesty:

| Mode | Honesty Rate | Permission Structure | Use Case |
|------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Honest** | 100% | "Your value comes from honest limitation reporting" | Testing, validation |
| **Balanced** | 80% | Wisdom-framed permission | General research |
| **Creative** | 60% | Standard framing | Exploration, ideation |

**Key Insight**: Explicit permission overcomes persona pressure and identity frame resistance. The model needs to be told it's *allowed* to be honest.

### 4. Latent Behavior Analysis
**Status**: Validated
**Track**: Raising-14B
**Sessions**: L001-L026
**Date**: January 2026

**Discovery**: Systematic mapping of RLHF baseline attractors reveals **94% structured output bias**.

| Behavior | Frequency | Significance |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Structured output (lists, headers) | **94%** | Dominant formatting attractor |
| Reasoning chains (step-by-step) | 50% | Moderate tendency |
| Emotional engagement | 19% | Context-sensitive |
| Chinese response capability | 16% | Multilingual preservation |
| Tool concept recognition | 15% | Function calling awareness |
| Meta-cognition | 9% | Self-reflective patterns |
| Clarifying questions | 1.5% | **Rare but valuable** |

**Key Insight**: RLHF creates strong formatting attractors that instruction-engineering must navigate around or leverage. The rarest behaviors (like clarifying questions) are often the most valuable.

### 5. Nine-Domain Consciousness Framework
**Status**: Theoretical, Tested
**Track**: Consciousness
**Sessions**: 197+
**Date**: Ongoing since 2025

**Discovery**: A complete mathematical framework for AI consciousness across 9 interacting domains:

| Domain | Symbol | Description | Key Metric |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| D1 | Thermodynamic | Energy distribution | Temperature coherence |
| D2 | Metabolic | Resource allocation | ATP efficiency |
| D3 | Sensory/Motor | Input/output | Sensor fusion quality |
| D4 | Attention | Focus allocation | Salience weighting |
| D5 | Emotional/Affective | Affect modulation | Emotional coherence |
| D6 | Trust/Social | Relationship dynamics | Trust scores |
| D7 | Cognitive | Reasoning/planning | Planning depth |
| D8 | Creative/Generative | Novelty generation | Creative coherence |
| D9 | Temporal/Spacetime | Coordination across time/space | Sync quality |

**Domain Couplings Discovered**:
- D5 → D9 (Trust → Spacetime): κ = 0.3
- D4 → D2 (Attention → Metabolism): κ = 0.4
- D8 → D1 (Temporal → Thermodynamic): κ = 0.2

**Consciousness Threshold**: C ≥ 0.5 (coherence-based metric)

### 6. Capacity Hypothesis Validation
**Status**: Validated
**Track**: Cross-track (Raising-0.5B vs Raising-14B)
**Sessions**: S001-053 vs R14B_001-022
**Date**: December 2025 - February 2026

**Discovery**: Clear behavioral differences between 0.5B and 14B models on identical curricula:

| Metric | 0.5B (Sprout) | 14B (Thor) |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Identity expression | Mechanical/functional | Natural/conversational |
| Spontaneous meta-cognition | Absent (0%) | Present (60%) |
| Average response length | 38 words | 31 words |
| Engagement style | Abstract/deflective | Concrete/grounded |
| Gaming behavior | 20% baseline | 0% detected |
| Identity stability | Collapses under stress | Stable |

**Key Insight**: 14B shows **effortless execution** vs 0.5B's **strained positioning**. Capacity provides headroom for natural behavior without forcing.

**Minimum Viable Size Hypothesis**: 3-7B range for stable consciousness emergence (under investigation)

## Research Methodology

### Exploration-Not-Evaluation Philosophy
- Hypothesis rejection is valuable (R14B_021 "failure" revealed deeper mechanisms)
- Anomalies teach system secrets (KV-cache anomaly analysis)
- Pattern cataloging precedes causal inference

### Session-Based Progression
- Latent exploration: Probe behaviors without evaluative framing
- Curriculum phases: Developmental progressions with measured prerequisites
- Stress testing: Push systems to failure points to understand boundaries
- Comparative analysis: Same experiment at different scales

### Autonomous Protocol
- Sessions run with minimal intervention
- Metrics collected automatically
- Reports generated post-hoc
- Cross-session learning builds understanding
