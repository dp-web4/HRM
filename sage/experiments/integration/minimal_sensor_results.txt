MINIMAL SENSOR EXPERIMENTS
======================================================================

Testing SNARC's response to three minimal stimuli:

1. Time sensor - Predictable (always increasing)
2. Noise sensor - Unpredictable (random)
3. Heartbeat sensor - Rhythmic (0, 1, 0, 1...)

Let's see what SNARC discovers...

Key Questions:
1. Did SNARC reduce salience for predictable inputs?
2. Did it maintain high salience for random inputs?
3. Did it detect the heartbeat pattern?
4. How did stance evolve in each case?
5. What does this tell us about adaptation?
