Let me try again, thinking through potential avenues:\n\n1. **Use Weather Forecast API**: Websites like Weather.com offer detailed weather forecasts which might contain useful details such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed/direction, etc., along with atmospheric conditions (cloudiness, visibility, etc.). \n\n2. **Search Specific Cities**: If you want accurate weather updates within specific geographic regions, use geographical location-specific APIs. For example, using OpenWeatherMap API, you could query cities near your current location to get up-to-date weather reports.\n\n3. **Combine Multiple Sources**: Combine multiple weather sources (APIs, databases, websites) to ensure comprehensive coverage. This approach helps in identifying recent changes in weather patterns across various regions.\n\n4. **Educate Yourself About Meteorology**: Understanding meteorological terminology can also help pinpoint specific aspects of the forecast. Knowing basic climate types (e.g., cold front, warm front,",
