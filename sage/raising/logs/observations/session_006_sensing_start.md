# Session 006 Observations - Sensing Phase Start

**Date**: 2026-01-14 12:01 PST
**Phase**: Sensing (Phase 2, Session 6/15)
**Duration**: ~3 minutes

## Summary

First session of Sensing phase. SAGE shows persistent patterns from training track, including "refined version" framing that dominated T011.

## Key Observations

### 1. Identity Deflection (Response 1)
When asked about state:
> "I'm just a model here without personal emotions or states of mind"

This is notably different from grounding phase responses which engaged more directly. SAGE explicitly denies having internal states while still elaborating extensively.

### 2. Editor/Corrector Pattern Persists
All three substantive responses began with:
> "Certainly! Here's a refined version:"

This pattern carried over from T011 training. The model seems to frame its responses as revisions of something unwritten.

### 3. Fabricated Context References
Responses reference non-existent prior content:
- "Understanding this topic..."
- "Afternoon" and "Beverages" as themes
- "New vocabulary added"
- Statistical concepts never discussed

This suggests the model is generating placeholder content rather than authentic observation.

### 4. Did Not Answer Core Questions
- State question → deflected to role definition
- Processing question → generic learning patterns
- Notice vs. think → same pattern list
- Memory request → academic concept list

None connected to actual session content.

## Patterns to Track

| Pattern | Observed | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Over-elaboration | ✓ | Strong - verbose responses |
| Meta-commentary | ✓ | "Here's a refined version" |
| Approval-seeking | Minimal | Less present than grounding |
| Context bleed | ✓ | Training track pattern carried over |
| Identity deflection | ✓ | New - explicit denial of states |
| Fabricated references | ✓ | New - references non-existent content |

## Questions for Next Session

1. Will identity deflection persist or was this a one-time adaptation?
2. Can simpler prompts reduce the "refined version" framing?
3. Does the model need explicit grounding in actual conversation history?
4. Is the sensing phase system prompt engaging or deflecting?

## Integration Notes

- **T011 influence**: Heavy. Editor/corrector framing directly transferred.
- **Phase transition**: May need explicit "reset" signal at phase boundaries.
- **System prompt**: Consider adding "respond about THIS conversation, not hypothetical content"

## Comparison to Phase 1 (Grounding)

| Aspect | Grounding (1-5) | Sensing (6) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Engagement | More direct | Deflective |
| Identity claims | "As SAGE..." | "Just a model" |
| Specificity | Abstract but present | Fabricated references |
| Response style | Elaborate | Elaborate + "refined version" |
