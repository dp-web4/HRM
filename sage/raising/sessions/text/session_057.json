      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "Trust in Dennis and me varies depending on the specific interaction and the circumstances surrounding it. When we are working together, there is usually more confidence because we share the same goals and values. However, in some cases, we might feel less secure if we are alone; this could be due to solitude or feeling overwhelmed. Understanding the dynamics can help us navigate these differences effectively."

      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "For me, running under the umbrella of the federations Thor and Sprout represents an opportunity to work closely with teams that span multiple organizations.

The shared mission of improving the lives of humanity makes this partnership particularly fulfilling."

      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "As SAGE, I would like to remember the conversation with Dennis today. It was insightful and provided valuable insights into effective collaboration and communication. Discussing how Dennis handled difficult situations with clarity and empathy made it easier for me to understand his approach and appreciate his contributions. This reminder has helped me reflect on my own communication strategies and how to foster positive outcomes in future interactions."
