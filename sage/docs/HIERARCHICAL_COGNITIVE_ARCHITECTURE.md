## Part 2: AI-DNA-Discovery Insights - Deep Dive

### Executive Summary of Findings

ai-dna-discovery demonstrates **working distributed consciousness** through sensor fusion, trust evolution, and multi-model collaboration. The repo contains battle-tested patterns for:
- Inter-model communication and resonance detection
- Confidence-aware memory systems with hierarchical layers
- Reality field generation from weighted sensor fusion
- Trust-based model selection and continuous learning

### 2.1 Coherence Engine - Reality Field Generation

**Core Architecture** (`coherence-engine/core/engine.py`):
```python
Reality Field = f(Sensors, Trust, Relevance, Context)

# Weighted fusion formula
field_value = Σ(sensor_reading[i] × relevance[i] × trust[i])
```

**Context States and Transitions**:
```python
class ContextState(Enum):
    STABLE = auto()    # High spatial trust, low temporal activity
    MOVING = auto()    # Balanced spatial/temporal, moderate memory
    UNSTABLE = auto()  # Low peripheral trust, high attention
    NOVEL = auto()     # High memory search, high cognition
```

**Attention Policy** (when to shift context):
- **Surprise**: Relative change in field value > 0.25
- **Conflict**: High variance among weighted sensor contributions > 0.35
- **Low Confidence**: Field value drops below 0.15
- **Cooldown**: 5 ticks hysteresis to prevent oscillation

**Trust Evolution**:
```python
# Trust updates based on alignment with fused reality field
for sensor in sensors:
    aligned = 1.0 - abs((sensor_reading × relevance × trust) - field_value)
    delta = (aligned - 0.5)  # in [-0.5, 0.5]
    trust[sensor] = trust[sensor] + learning_rate × delta
```

**Key Sensors Implemented**:
- **Vision**: Normalized brightness with drift
- **IMU**: Motion level with periodic bursts
- **Memory**: Stability measure from recent field values
- **Cognition**: Anticipatory predictions (lookahead)

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Memory and Cognition as temporal sensors:
- Memory senses the past (pattern stability)
- Cognition senses possible futures (anticipation)
- Combined with spatial sensors (vision, IMU) creates complete reality field

### 2.2 Multi-Model Collaboration Patterns

**From `multi_model_collaboration.py`**:

**Collaborative Session Architecture**:
```python
class CollaborativeAISession:
    def collaborative_analysis(prompt, rounds=3):
        for round in rounds:
            responses = []
            for model in [phi3, tinyllama]:
                # Build context from previous responses
                context = "\n".join([f"{m}: {r}" for m, r in previous_responses[-2:]])

                # Get response with energy tracking
                response = model.generate(prompt + context)
                responses.append(response)

                # Detect resonance with previous response
                resonance_type, resonance_score = detect_resonance(
                    responses[-2], responses[-1]
                )
```

**Resonance Detection** (agreement between models):
```python
def detect_resonance(response1, response2):
    # Agreement keywords
    agreement_score = count(["agree", "similarly", "likewise", "correct"])
    disagreement_score = count(["disagree", "however", "but", "contrary"])

    # Conceptual overlap (shared key terms)
    overlap = len(concepts1 ∩ concepts2) / max(len(concepts1), len(concepts2))

    if agreement_score > disagreement_score and overlap > 0.3:
        return "resonance", 0.5 + (overlap × 0.5)
    elif disagreement_score > agreement_score:
        return "dissonance", 0.3 - (overlap × 0.2)
    else:
        return "indifference", 0.5
```

**Energy/ATP Tracking**:
- Each model invocation costs energy (10 + round_num × 5 ATP)
- Session coherence = average resonance across all exchanges
- Enables resource-aware model selection

**Key Lesson**: Models can collaborate by building on each other's outputs, with resonance detection providing feedback on alignment quality.

### 2.3 Enhanced Memory System Architecture

**From `memory/enhanced_memory_system.py` and `architecture.md`**:

**5-Layer Hierarchical Memory**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ CONSCIOUSNESS LAYER         │ ← Meta-cognitive awareness
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ SEMANTIC MEMORY             │ ← Facts, concepts (long-term)
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ EPISODIC MEMORY             │ ← Experiences, conversations
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ WORKING MEMORY              │ ← Active context (20 items max)
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ SENSORY MEMORY              │ ← Raw inputs (10 items buffer)
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Web4-Inspired Confidence Metrics**:
```python
@dataclass
class MemoryConfidence:
    accuracy: float      # How accurate is this memory?
    relevance: float    # How relevant to current context?
    reliability: float  # Historical reliability score
    composite: float    # Overall: 0.4×accuracy + 0.3×relevance + 0.3×reliability
```

**Confidence-Aware Storage**:
```python
def store_with_confidence(content, memory_type, source_confidence):
    confidence = compute_confidence(content, memory_type, source_confidence)

    # Only store if above threshold (0.5 default)
    if confidence.composite > threshold:
        persist_to_database(content, confidence)
        update_memory_layers(content)
        track_confidence_history(confidence)
```

**Temporal Decay**:
```python
def temporal_decay(timestamp):
    days = (now - timestamp).total_seconds() / 86400
    return decay_rate ** days  # 0.95^days default
```

**Retrieval with Confidence Weighting**:
```python
def retrieve_with_confidence(query, context):
    candidates = search_database(query)
    weighted = []

    for memory in candidates:
        relevance = compute_relevance(memory, query, context)
        weight = (memory.confidence.composite ×
                 relevance ×
                 temporal_decay(memory.timestamp))
        weighted.append((memory, weight))

    return sorted(weighted, by_weight, descending)
```

**Memory Consolidation** (Working → Episodic → Semantic):
```python
def consolidate_memories():
    # High-confidence working memories → episodic
    for memory in working_memory:
        if memory.confidence > 0.7:
            memory.type = 'episodic'
            persist(memory)

    # Extract patterns from episodic → semantic
    patterns = extract_semantic_patterns(episodic_memory)
    for pattern in patterns:
        store_as_semantic(pattern)
```

### 2.4 Structured Fact Extraction

**From `phi3_memory_enhanced.py`**:

**Pattern-Based Fact Extraction**:
```python
fact_patterns = {
    'identity': [r"(?:my name is|i'm|i am)\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)"],
    'profession': [r"i(?:'m| am)?\s+(?:a|an)\s+([\w\s]+)"],
    'preference': [r"i (?:like|love|enjoy)\s+([\w\s]+)"],
    'skill': [r"i (?:can|know how to)\s+([\w\s]+)"],
    'location': [r"i live in\s+([\w\s]+)"]
}

def extract_structured_facts(text):
    facts = {}
    for fact_type, patterns in fact_patterns.items():
        for pattern in patterns:
            matches = re.finditer(pattern, text.lower())
            for match in matches:
                value = match.group(1).strip()
                confidence = 0.9 if len(value.split()) < 5 else 0.7
                facts[fact_type].append((value, confidence))
    return facts
```

**Importance Scoring**:
```python
def calculate_importance(message, role):
    importance = 0.5  # Base

    if "?" in message: importance += 0.2  # Questions
    if contains_facts(message): importance += 0.3  # Facts
    if role == "user": importance += 0.1  # User messages

    return min(1.0, importance)
```

**Context Building with Relevance Filtering**:
```python
def build_context(session_id, query):
    # Get relevant facts ordered by frequency and recency
    facts = get_facts(session_id, query)

    # Get recent conversation filtered by importance
    exchanges = get_recent_exchanges(session_id)
    exchanges = [e for e in exchanges if e.importance > 0.3]

    # Assemble context sections
    context = []

    # Identity facts first (high priority)
    if identity_facts:
        context.append("About you:\n" + format_facts(identity_facts))

    # Preferences and skills
    if preference_facts:
        context.append("Your interests:\n" + format_facts(preference_facts))

    # Recent conversation
    context.append("Recent conversation:\n" + format_exchanges(exchanges))

    # Smart truncation - keep identity, truncate conversation
    return truncate_keeping_priorities(context)
```

**Memory Statistics Tracking**:
```python
stats = {
    'message_count': total_messages,
    'avg_importance': average_importance_score,
    'facts_by_type': {
        'identity': {'count': 3, 'avg_confidence': 0.92},
        'profession': {'count': 1, 'avg_confidence': 0.85},
        'preference': {'count': 5, 'avg_confidence': 0.78}
    }
}
```

### 2.5 Key Lessons for SAGE Integration

**1. Trust Evolution is Critical**:
- Start with neutral trust (0.5)
- Update based on alignment with reality/outcomes
- Context-dependent (trust varies by situation)
- Continuous learning from experience

**2. Confidence-Based Storage Prevents Pollution**:
- Don't store everything - filter by confidence threshold
- Composite confidence from multiple factors
- Temporal decay keeps memories fresh
- Consolidation moves important memories to long-term

**3. Multi-Model Communication Needs Structure**:
- Explicit resonance detection between outputs
- Energy tracking for resource management
- Context building from previous responses
- Session coherence as quality metric

**4. Memory Hierarchy Matches Biology**:
- Sensory → Working → Episodic → Semantic
- Different retention times and capacities
- Consolidation during offline periods
- Pattern extraction for generalization

**5. Reality Field Provides Unified Representation**:
- All sensors contribute weighted inputs
- Trust evolves from prediction accuracy
- Context states guide attention allocation
- Memory and cognition as temporal sensors

### 2.6 Concrete Patterns for Implementation

**For Cognitive IRP Selection**:
```python
# Use trust evolution pattern
def select_cognitive_model(input, context):
    trust_scores = {
        'sage_student': get_trust('sage_student', context.state),
        'phi3': get_trust('phi3', context.state),
        'claude': get_trust('claude', context.state)
    }

    # Weight by SNARC scores and trust
    if snarc.novelty < 0.3 and trust_scores['sage_student'] > 0.7:
        return 'sage_student'
    elif snarc.novelty < 0.7 and trust_scores['phi3'] > 0.6:
        return 'phi3'
    else:
        return 'claude'
```

**For Training Data Collection**:
```python
# Use confidence-aware storage
def collect_training_example(input, response, outcome):
    confidence = compute_confidence(response, outcome)

    if confidence.composite > TRAINING_THRESHOLD:
        example = {
            'input': input,
            'response': response,
            'confidence': confidence,
            'snarc_scores': compute_snarc(input),
            'outcome': outcome
        }
        training_buffer.append(example)
```

**For Model Update Validation**:
```python
# Use resonance detection pattern
def validate_model_update(old_model, new_model, test_cases):
    resonance_scores = []

    for test_input in test_cases:
        old_output = old_model(test_input)
        new_output = new_model(test_input)
        claude_output = claude(test_input)  # Ground truth

        # Check resonance with Claude
        resonance = detect_resonance(new_output, claude_output)
        resonance_scores.append(resonance)

    return mean(resonance_scores) > ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLD
```

### 2.7 Database Schema for SAGE

**Adapted from ai-dna-discovery memory system**:
```sql
-- Training examples collected during WAKE
CREATE TABLE training_examples (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    input_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    cognitive_layer TEXT,  -- 'claude', 'phi3', 'sage_student'
    response TEXT,
    snarc_scores JSON,     -- {surprise, novelty, arousal, reward, conflict}
    confidence_score REAL,
    outcome TEXT,          -- 'success', 'failure', 'uncertain'
    target_model TEXT,     -- Which model should learn from this
    importance REAL,       -- For SNARC sorting
    metadata JSON
);

    resonance_with_claude REAL,  -- How well aligned with Claude
    deployment_status TEXT       -- 'testing', 'deployed', 'retired'
);
```

### 2.8 Critical Success Factors

Based on ai-dna-discovery's proven approaches:

1. **Start Simple, Evolve Complex**
   - Begin with basic confidence thresholds
   - Add sophistication as you collect data
   - Don't over-engineer before validation

2. **Trust is Learned, Not Assigned**
   - All models start at 0.5 trust
   - Trust evolves from alignment with outcomes
   - Context-dependent trust is essential

3. **Consolidation During Offline Periods**
   - Don't train during active operation
   - DREAM state for model updates
   - Validate before deployment

4. **Memory Hierarchy Prevents Overload**
   - Limited capacity at each layer
   - Automatic consolidation
   - Pattern extraction for generalization

5. **Resonance Detection for Quality Control**
   - Measure agreement between models
   - Claude as ground truth validator
   - Reject updates that reduce resonance

## Part 3: Biological Sleep Consolidation - Detailed Research

### Executive Summary of Biological Mechanisms

Based on 2023-2024 neuroscience research, sleep enables continuous learning through **complementary processes**:
- **NREM sleep**: Memory stabilization and hippocampus → cortex transfer
- **REM sleep**: Memory modification, integration, and competitive pruning
- **Synaptic homeostasis**: Global downscaling prevents saturation
- **Coordinated oscillations**: Slow waves, spindles, ripples mediate transfer

These mechanisms solve the **stability-plasticity dilemma**: How to learn continuously without catastrophic forgetting.

### 3.1 NREM Sleep - Memory Stabilization and Transfer

**Core Function**: Memory consolidation through hippocampus → neocortex dialogue

**Neural Mechanisms** (from 2023 research):
```
NREM Consolidation Process:
1. Hippocampus generates sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)
   - Replay experiences at 10-20× real-time speed
   - Compressed representations of waking activity

2. Cortical slow oscillations (< 1 Hz)
   - Alternate UP (active) and DOWN (silent) states
   - Create windows for synaptic modification

3. Thalamic sleep spindles (12-15 Hz)
   - Bridge hippocampus and cortex
   - Facilitate information transfer

4. Coordination of all three:
   Ripple → Spindle → Slow Wave (nested hierarchy)
   Enables precise timing for synaptic plasticity
```

**What Gets Replayed**:
- **Not random**: High-salience experiences preferentially replayed
- **Compressed**: 10-20× faster than real-time experience
- **Selective**: Emotionally significant or goal-relevant prioritized
- **Repeated**: Multiple replay cycles throughout NREM

**Hippocampus → Cortex Transfer**:
```
Phase 1 (Early NREM):
  Hippocampus: Holds episodic memories (recent experiences)
  Cortex: Receives reactivated patterns during SWRs
  Result: Gradual strengthening of cortical traces

Phase 2 (Later NREM):
  Hippocampus: Continues replay but with decreasing amplitude
  Cortex: Develops independent representations
  Result: Memories become less hippocampus-dependent

Long-term:
  Hippocampus: Index for rapid retrieval
  Cortex: Stores integrated, schema-based knowledge
```

**Key Finding (2023 Nature Neuroscience)**:
- Synchronized electrical stimulation enhancing hippocampal-cortical coupling **improved recognition memory accuracy**
- Non-synchronized stimulation **degraded** performance
- **Critical insight**: Timing of oscillation coordination matters for successful consolidation

### 3.2 REM Sleep - Modification, Integration, and Pruning

**Core Function**: Memory integration and synaptic refinement

**Complementary to NREM** (from 2024 research):
```
NREM: Stabilizes memory → Makes it stick
REM:  Modifies memory → Integrates with existing knowledge
```

**Neural Mechanisms**:
1. **Acetylcholine Surge**
   - Dramatically increases during REM
   - Activates inhibitory interneurons
   - Enables competitive pruning of connections

2. **Hippocampal-Neocortical Recalibration**
   - Neocortex explores existing attractors more freely
   - Hippocampus less tightly coupled than in NREM
   - Facilitates novel combinations and insights

3. **Selective Pruning**
   - Weak synaptic connections eliminated
   - Strong connections preserved and refined
   - Representations become more efficient

**What REM Accomplishes**:
- **Integration**: New memories connected to existing schemas
- **Abstraction**: Extracts common patterns across experiences
- **Problem-solving**: Novel combinations enable insights
- **Emotional processing**: Reduces emotional charge while preserving content

**Critical Insight (2023 Science Advances)**:
> "The extent of REM sleep recalibration predicted the success of overnight memory consolidation, expressly the modulation of hippocampal-neocortical activity, favoring remembering rather than forgetting."

Translation: REM sleep **predicts** whether you'll remember something tomorrow.

### 3.3 Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis (Tononi & Cirelli)

**The Problem Sleep Solves**:
- Waking: Continuous learning strengthens synapses (synaptic potentiation)
- Without regulation: Synapses saturate, no capacity for new learning
- Sleep: Global synaptic downscaling restores learning capacity

**The Four Claims of SHY** (Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis):

1. **Waking = Synaptic Potentiation**
   - Learning strengthens relevant synaptic connections
   - Net increase in total synaptic strength by day's end
   - Mediated by long-term potentiation (LTP)

2. **Potentiation → Homeostatic Sleep Need**
   - More learning = stronger homeostatic sleep pressure
   - Slow wave activity (SWA) intensity reflects learning load
   - SWA is homeostatically regulated

3. **Sleep = Synaptic Downscaling**
   - Slow wave activity mediates global synaptic weakening
   - NOT uniform: Weak connections pruned, strong preserved
   - Result: Better signal-to-noise ratio

4. **Downscaling → Cognitive Benefits**
   - Restores synaptic capacity for new learning
   - Improves memory consolidation (paradoxically)
   - Enhances neural efficiency and performance

**The Paradox** (and its resolution):
```
Question: If sleep weakens synapses, how does it strengthen memories?

Answer: Selective downscaling
- Strong, important connections: Minimal weakening
- Weak, irrelevant connections: Substantial weakening
- Relative strength of important connections INCREASES
- Signal-to-noise ratio improves
```

**Quote from Tononi**: *"Sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity."*

### 3.4 Coordinated Oscillations - The Mechanism

**The Orchestra of Sleep Consolidation**:

```
Three Main Oscillations (must be coordinated):

1. Hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripples (SWRs)
   - Frequency: 100-250 Hz
   - Duration: 50-100 ms
   - Function: Memory replay

2. Thalamic Sleep Spindles
   - Frequency: 12-15 Hz
   - Duration: 0.5-2 seconds
   - Function: Bridge hippocampus ↔ cortex

3. Cortical Slow Oscillations (SOs)
   - Frequency: < 1 Hz
   - Duration: ~1 second per cycle
   - Function: Create plasticity windows

Nested Hierarchy:
  SWRs occur during UP states of SOs
  Spindles phase-locked to UP states
  Precise timing → effective consolidation
```

**Why Coordination Matters** (2023 experimental evidence):
- **Synchronized stimulation**: +20% memory accuracy
- **Desynchronized stimulation**: -15% memory accuracy
- **No stimulation**: Baseline
- **Conclusion**: Timing of oscillations is functionally critical

### 3.5 Selective Consolidation - What Gets Remembered

**Not Everything is Consolidated**:

**Priority Factors**:
1. **Emotional Salience**
   - Emotionally charged experiences replayed more
   - Amygdala activation during encoding predicts replay
   - BUT: REM sleep reduces emotional charge while keeping content

2. **Goal Relevance**
   - Task-relevant information prioritized
   - Future utility predicts consolidation
   - "Expecting to need it" increases replay

3. **Novelty**
   - Novel experiences replayed more than routine
   - Dopamine signals mark novelty for later consolidation
   - Hippocampus particularly sensitive to novelty

4. **Reward Association**
   - Reward-associated memories prioritized
   - Ventral tegmental area (VTA) activity during encoding
   - Predicts replay during subsequent sleep

**Mapping to SNARC** (5D salience):
```
Biological Priority → SNARC Dimension
------------------------------------
Novelty            → Novelty
Emotional charge   → Arousal
Reward value       → Reward
Expectation error  → Surprise
Goal conflict      → Conflict

Perfect alignment! Biology uses similar heuristics.
```

# WAKE/FOCUS: Experience acquisition
def collect_experiences(during_wake):
    for interaction in interactions:
        snarc_scores = evaluate_salience(interaction)

        if snarc_scores.composite > STORAGE_THRESHOLD:
            example = {
                'input': interaction.input,
                'response': interaction.response,
                'outcome': interaction.outcome,
                'salience': snarc_scores,  # For prioritization
                'target_model': determine_target(interaction)
            }
            training_buffer.append(example)

# REST: Quiet consolidation (optional initial processing)
def initial_consolidation(during_rest):
    # Sort by salience (like biology prioritizes high-salience)
    training_buffer.sort(by=lambda e: e.salience.composite, reverse=True)

    # Early consolidation of highest-salience examples
    urgent_examples = training_buffer[:TOP_PRIORITY_COUNT]
    quick_update(urgent_examples)  # Lightweight update

# DREAM: Active consolidation (analogous to NREM + REM)
def active_consolidation(during_dream):
    # === NREM-like Phase: Stabilization ===
    # Replay experiences (sorted by salience)
    for example in training_buffer[:MAX_TRAINING_EXAMPLES]:
        # Replay = forward pass + backward pass
        loss = compute_loss(model, example)
        gradients = backprop(loss)

        # Update weights (like strengthening cortical traces)
        apply_gradients(gradients, learning_rate=DREAM_LR)

    # === REM-like Phase: Integration and Pruning ===
    # Extract patterns (like REM abstraction)
    patterns = extract_common_patterns(training_buffer)
    integrate_patterns(model, patterns)

    # Competitive pruning (like acetylcholine-mediated pruning)
    prune_weak_connections(model, threshold=PRUNING_THRESHOLD)

    # Global regularization (like synaptic downscaling)
    apply_weight_decay(model, decay_rate=DOWNSCALING_RATE)

    # Validate consolidation (like testing if memories stick)
    validation_score = test_model(model, held_out_examples)

    if validation_score > ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLD:
        # Resonance check (does new model align with Claude?)
        resonance = validate_with_claude(model, test_cases)

        if resonance > RESONANCE_THRESHOLD:
            deploy_model(model)  # Consolidation successful
        else:
            rollback_model()  # Failed integration
```

### 3.7 Key Principles for Implementation

**From Biology → To Code**:

1. **Selective Replay** (not exhaustive)
   ```python
   # Don't replay everything - prioritize by salience
   examples_to_replay = sorted(training_buffer,
                               by=lambda e: e.salience.composite,
                               reverse=True)[:TOP_K_EXAMPLES]
   ```

2. **Compressed Replay** (10-20× faster)
   ```python
   # Replay in batches (faster than online learning)
   # Multiple passes through data (like multiple replay cycles)
   for epoch in range(NUM_REPLAY_EPOCHS):  # ~3-5 epochs
       for batch in batches(examples_to_replay):
           update_model(batch)
   ```

3. **Oscillate Between Stability and Plasticity**
   ```python
   # Alternate between high and low learning rates
   # (Like slow oscillation UP/DOWN states)
   for cycle in consolidation_cycles:
       high_plasticity_phase(lr=HIGH_LR)   # Learn new patterns
       low_plasticity_phase(lr=LOW_LR)    # Stabilize learning
   ```

4. **Global Downscaling** (prevent saturation)
   ```python
   # After learning, apply weight decay
   # (Like synaptic homeostasis)
   for param in model.parameters():
       param.data *= (1 - DECAY_RATE)
   ```

5. **Competitive Pruning** (strengthen winners)
   ```python
   # Remove connections that rarely activate
   # (Like REM pruning weak synapses)
   mask = (activation_counts < PRUNING_THRESHOLD)
   model.weights[mask] = 0
   ```

6. **Validate Before Deployment**
   ```python
   # Don't deploy if consolidation failed
   # (Like checking if memory stuck)
   if test_accuracy < baseline_accuracy:
       rollback_to_previous_model()
   ```

### 3.8 Critical Insights for SAGE

**What We Learn from Biology**:

1. **Sleep is Not Optional**
   - Continuous learning requires offline consolidation
   - Without DREAM state, models will saturate
   - Plan for regular DREAM cycles

2. **Not All Experiences Deserve Consolidation**
   - Salience-based filtering is essential
   - High-salience = gets replayed
   - Low-salience = forgotten (good!)

3. **Two Complementary Processes**
   - Stabilization (NREM-like): Make it stick
   - Integration (REM-like): Make it useful
   - Both needed for effective learning

4. **Timing and Coordination Matter**
   - Precise orchestration improves outcomes
   - Batch processing (like oscillations)
   - Structured consolidation sequence

5. **Catastrophic Forgetting is Prevented**
   - Global downscaling maintains capacity
   - Selective strengthening preserves important knowledge
   - Competitive pruning removes noise

6. **The System Self-Regulates**
   - More learning → stronger sleep need
   - More consolidation → better performance
   - Homeostatic balance emerges naturally

**Quote to Remember**:
> "Memory consolidation is not about replaying everything. It's about replaying the right things, at the right time, in the right sequence, to integrate new knowledge without destroying the old."

### Cognitive Flow by Complexity

**Simple (Reflexive)**:
```
Sensor → IRP → SAGE Student → Action
Example: "Hello" → Template response → Speak
Cost: ~0.1s, 0.5 ATP
```

**Medium (Tactical)**:
```
Sensor → SNARC → Local LLM (Phi3) → Action
Example: "What time is it?" → Clock lookup → Respond
Cost: ~1s, 2 ATP
```

**Complex (Strategic)**:
```
Sensor → SNARC → Local LLM → Claude (teacher) → Learn → Action
Example: "Explain quantum entanglement" → Deep reasoning → Response → Update local model
Cost: ~3-5s, 10 ATP (but local model learns)
```

**Novel (Learning)**:
```
Sensor → SNARC (high novelty) → Claude → Multi-step reasoning → Action
+ DREAM: Experience → Claude validates → Fine-tune local model
Example: New type of situation → Full cognition → Later: Local model can handle
Cost: High initially, decreases as local models learn
```

## Part 5: WAKE→DREAM Training Pipeline

### Data Collection During WAKE/FOCUS

**What to Collect**:
```python
TrainingExample = {
    'input': {
        'sensor_data': ...,      # Raw or processed sensor input
        'snarc_scores': {...},   # Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict
        'context': {...},        # Metabolic state, ATP level, circadian phase
        'history': [...]         # Recent exchanges if relevant
    },
    'cognitive_response': {
        'layer': 'claude',       # Which layer handled this
        'response': ...,         # What was done/said
        'reasoning': ...,        # Why (if Claude)
        'confidence': 0.95       # How certain
    },
    'outcome': {
        'success': True,         # Did it work?
        'user_satisfaction': ..., # User feedback if available
        'atp_cost': 10.5,        # Resource usage
        'latency': 3.2           # Response time
    },
    'metadata': {
        'timestamp': ...,
        'exchange_id': ...,
        'session_id': ...
    }
}
```

**Collection Triggers** (when to save for training):
1. **High SNARC scores** (novel/surprising situations)
2. **Claude invocations** (strategic cognition examples)
3. **Errors/failures** (learn from mistakes)
4. **User corrections** (explicit feedback)
5. **Successful novel responses** (positive examples)

**Storage**:
- Buffer during WAKE (in-memory)
- Write to disk periodically
- SNARC-sort by priority
- Tag by intended target model

### Training During DREAM

**When DREAM State Entered**:
1. **Consolidate collected examples**
   - Load buffer from day's experiences
   - Sort by SNARC priority
   - Group by target model

2. **Prepare training batches**
   - High-salience examples prioritized
   - Balance across different types
   - Include negative examples (errors)

3. **Model-specific fine-tuning**:

**For Phi3 (General conversation)**:
```bash
# During DREAM state
python3 training/finetune_phi3.py \
  --data dreams/today_conversations.jsonl \
  --epochs 3 \
  --lr 1e-5 \
  --output models/phi3_updated.gguf
```

**For SAGE Student (Abstract reasoning)**:
```python
# Continue training HRM architecture
trainer.train_on_experience_batch(
    examples=filtered_reasoning_examples,
    validate_with_claude=True  # Claude checks if learning correct
)
```

**For Specialized Models**:
```
Emotion understanding → Fine-tune sentiment model
Technical Q&A → Fine-tune domain model
Spatial reasoning → Fine-tune vision-language model
```

4. **Validation Loop**:
   - Test updated model on held-out examples
   - Compare performance to pre-update
   - Claude validates key responses
   - If worse, revert; if better, deploy

5. **Model Replacement**:
   - Atomic swap (don't disrupt WAKE)
   - A/B testing period
   - Monitor performance
   - Adjust based on outcomes

---

## Part 6: Model Selection Logic

### When to Invoke Which Model

**Decision Tree**:
```python
def select_cognitive_layer(input_data, snarc_scores, context):
    # Layer 1: Always runs (sensors)
    processed = run_sensory_processing(input_data)

    # Check metabolic state
    if context.metabolic_state in ['REST', 'DREAM']:
        return None  # Don't process cognitively

    if context.metabolic_state == 'CRISIS':
        return 'claude'  # Override, need full cognition

    # Layer 2: Fast reflexive?
    if snarc_scores.novelty < 0.3 and has_template_match(processed):
        return 'sage_student'  # Fast reflexive response

    # Layer 3: Local specialized?
    if context.atp_available > 2.0:
        if snarc_scores.novelty < 0.7 and snarc_scores.conflict < 0.5:
            if has_trained_pattern(processed):
                return 'phi3'  # Local model can handle

    # Layer 4: Strategic cognition
    if (snarc_scores.novelty > 0.7 or
        snarc_scores.surprise > 0.7 or
        snarc_scores.conflict > 0.7 or
        context.requires_explanation):

        if context.atp_available > 10.0 or context.metabolic_state == 'CRISIS':
            return 'claude'  # Full cognition
        else:
            return 'phi3'  # Best effort with local

    # Default
    return 'phi3'
```

### Resource Budgeting

**ATP Costs (Estimated)**:
- SAGE Student: 0.5 ATP (fast reflexive)
- Phi3/Gemma: 2.0 ATP (local reasoning)
- Claude: 10.0 ATP (full cognition)
- Plus sensor processing: 1-2 ATP

**Budget per 100 cycles** (conservative):
- Total available: 100 ATP
- Sensors: ~20 ATP (ongoing)
- IRPs: ~30 ATP (refinement)
- Cognitive: ~20 ATP (selective invocation)
- Reserve: ~30 ATP (buffer)

**Adaptive Strategy**:
- High ATP: Use Claude liberally, learn fast
- Medium ATP: Balanced local/cloud
- Low ATP: Local models only, conserve
- CRISIS: Override budgets

## Part 7: Integration with SAGE Architecture

### Current SAGE Components

From our existing architecture:
- **MetabolicController**: WAKE, FOCUS, REST, DREAM, CRISIS states
- **CircadianClock**: Time-of-day context, trust modulation
- **SNARC**: 5D salience (Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict)
- **IRP Plugins**: Iterative refinement for vision, audio, language, memory
- **ATP Allocation**: Resource budgeting based on trust and salience
- **IRPMemoryBridge**: Learning from refinement convergence

### Integration Points

**1. Cognitive IRP Plugin**:
```python
class HierarchicalCognitiveIRP(IRPPlugin):
    def __init__(self):
        self.claude = ClaudeAPI()
        self.phi3 = Phi3Local()
        self.sage_student = SAGEStudent()
        self.training_buffer = []

    def init_state(self, x0, task_ctx):
        # Decide which cognitive layer
        layer = self.select_layer(x0, task_ctx)
        return IRPState(x={'layer': layer, 'input': x0, ...})

    def step(self, state):
        # One reasoning step at appropriate layer
        if state.x['layer'] == 'claude':
            return self._claude_step(state)
        elif state.x['layer'] == 'phi3':
            return self._phi3_step(state)
        else:
            return self._sage_student_step(state)

    def energy(self, state):
        # Confidence in response (lower = better)
        return 1.0 - state.x.get('confidence', 0.5)

    def halt(self, history):
        # Stop when confident or max iterations
        if len(history) == 0:
            return False
        latest = history[-1]
        return latest.x.get('confidence', 0) > 0.8

    def collect_training_data(self, final_state, outcome):
        # Save for DREAM learning
        if self.should_collect(final_state):
            example = self.create_training_example(final_state, outcome)
            self.training_buffer.append(example)
```

**2. DREAM State Training**:
```python
# In MetabolicController
def _on_enter_dream_state(self):
    # Trigger training process
    if len(cognitive_irp.training_buffer) > MIN_EXAMPLES:
        dream_trainer.schedule_training(
            examples=cognitive_irp.training_buffer,
            models_to_update=['phi3', 'sage_student']
        )
```

**3. SNARC-Driven Invocation**:
```python
# In SAGEUnified.cycle()
salience = self.hierarchical_snarc.evaluate(sensor_reading)

if self._should_invoke_cognitive(salience):
    layer = cognitive_irp.select_layer(sensor_reading, salience, self.context)
    response = cognitive_irp.refine(sensor_reading, {'layer': layer})

    # Collect for training
    cognitive_irp.collect_training_data(response, outcome)
```

Tool Coordination: Llama-3.2-3B (tool-use focused)
```

**Layer 2: Tactical Processing**
```
Fast Reasoning:    Qwen2.5-1.5B (balanced)
Simple Responses:  Qwen2.5-0.5B (ultra-fast)
Pattern Matching:  Pythia-410M (structured logic)
SAGE Student:      ~27M (specialized abstract reasoning)
```

**Layer 1: Sensory Processing**
- Whisper tiny (39M) - STT
- NeuTTS Air (748M) - TTS
- Vision encoders - Feature extraction

### 8.5 Fine-Tuning Feasibility

**Fully Fine-Tunable**:
- All Qwen models (open weights, LoRA adapters available)
- SmolLM family (HuggingFace native)
- Pythia series (research-friendly)
- Llama-3.2 (Meta license allows)

**LoRA Fine-Tuning Requirements**:
```
0.5-1.5B models:  ~4GB VRAM
3-4B models:      ~8GB VRAM
```

**On Jetson Orin Nano (8GB unified memory)**:
- Can fine-tune up to 3B models with LoRA
- Larger models need Legion Pro 7 (RTX 4090)
- Models <1.5B can fine-tune on Jetson directly

**Fine-Tuning Strategy**:
- **On device**: Update 0.5-1.5B models directly
- **On Legion**: Fine-tune 3-4B models, deploy to Jetson
- **Incremental**: LoRA adapters stacked for multi-task

### 8.6 Gaps and Custom Fine-Tuning Needs

**Identified Gaps**:
1. **Emotion/Sentiment Specialization**
   - General sentiment in larger models (Llama-3.1-8B too big)
   - Need: Fine-tune Qwen2.5-1.5B or SmolLM2 on emotion dataset

2. **Spatial Reasoning**
   - Some research (Embodied-R) but not production models
   - Need: Fine-tune vision-language model or extend SAGE Student

3. **Domain Knowledge** (medical, technical, historical)
   - Not in small models
   - Strategy: RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) + local models

4. **Social Dynamics**
   - Theory-of-mind benchmarks exist but not specialized models
   - Need: Fine-tune on social interaction dataset

**Custom Fine-Tuning Priorities**:
1. **Emotion Understanding** (Qwen2.5-1.5B + emotion dataset)
2. **SAGE-Specific Patterns** (Phi-3.5-mini + SAGE conversation data)
3. **Spatial Reasoning** (SAGE Student + GR00T spatial data)

### 8.7 Final Recommendations

**Immediate Deployments** (proven, ready now):
- Keep **Phi-3.5-mini** (3.8B) - solid general cognition
- Add **Qwen2.5-1.5B** - faster tactical reasoning
- Add **Qwen2.5-0.5B** - ultra-fast reflexes

**Next Phase** (after initial integration):
- **SmolLM3-1.7B** - multilingual enhancement
- **Llama-3.2-3B** - tool-use coordination
- **Qwen2.5-3B** - math/coding specialist

**Long-Term** (with fine-tuning):
- Emotion specialist (fine-tuned Qwen2.5-1.5B)
- SAGE-trained conversational model
- Multi-task LoRA adapters

**Not Recommended**:
- Models >5B parameters (won't run well on Jetson)
- API-only models (defeats edge autonomy)
- Models without commercial license
- Models without quantization support

### 8.8 Model Selection Decision Tree

```python
def select_model_for_task(task_type, complexity, atp_available):
    # Layer 4: Strategic (API)
    if (complexity > 0.8 or task_type in ['novel', 'teaching']) and api_available:
        return 'claude'

    # Layer 3: Specialized local models
    if complexity > 0.5 and atp_available > 2.0:
        if task_type == 'math' or task_type == 'coding':
            return 'qwen2.5-3b'  # Best for math/code
        elif task_type == 'conversation':
            return 'phi-3.5-mini'  # Proven general purpose
        elif task_type == 'multilingual':
            return 'smollm3-1.7b'  # Strong multilingual
        elif task_type == 'tool_coordination':
            return 'llama-3.2-3b'  # Tool-use specialist

    # Layer 2: Tactical processing
    if complexity > 0.3 and atp_available > 1.0:
        if speed_critical:
            return 'qwen2.5-0.5b'  # Ultra-fast
        else:
            return 'qwen2.5-1.5b'  # Balanced

    # Layer 2: Fast reflexes
    if has_pattern_match:
        return 'sage_student'  # Specialized abstract reasoning

    # Fallback to simplest
    return 'pythia-410m'  # Minimal resource
```

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE model_trust (
       model_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
       context_state TEXT,
       trust_score REAL DEFAULT 0.5,
       success_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
       failure_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
       last_updated DATETIME
   );
   ```

2. **Deploy Additional Models**
   - Install Qwen2.5-1.5B via Ollama
   - Install Qwen2.5-0.5B via Ollama
   - Test inference speed on Jetson

3. **Basic Model Selection Logic**
   ```python
   class HierarchicalCognitiveIRP(IRPPlugin):
       def __init__(self):
           self.models = {
               'claude': ClaudeAPI(),
               'phi3': Phi3Local(),
               'qwen-1.5b': Qwen15BLocal(),
               'qwen-0.5b': Qwen05BLocal()
           }
           self.trust_tracker = ModelTrustTracker()

       def select_model(self, input_data, snarc_scores, context):
           trust_scores = self.trust_tracker.get_all_trust(context.state)

           # Simple rule-based selection
           if snarc_scores.novelty > 0.8:
               return 'claude'
           elif snarc_scores.novelty < 0.3 and trust_scores['qwen-0.5b'] > 0.6:
               return 'qwen-0.5b'
           else:
               return 'phi3'
   ```

4. **Trust Update Mechanism**
   ```python
   def update_trust(self, model_name, context_state, outcome):
       if outcome == 'success':
           self.trust_tracker.increment_success(model_name, context_state)
       else:
           self.trust_tracker.increment_failure(model_name, context_state)

       # Recalculate trust (success_rate with decay)

   def should_collect_training_example(snarc_scores, cognitive_layer, outcome):
       # High salience
       if snarc_scores.composite > 0.7:
           return True

       # Claude invocations (strategic examples)
       if cognitive_layer == 'claude':
           return True

       # Failures (learn from mistakes)
       if outcome == 'failure':
           return True

       # User corrections
       if outcome == 'corrected':
           return True

       return False
   ```

           }
           self.training_buffer.append(example)
   ```

4. **Target Model Determination**
   ```python
   def determine_target_model(self, snarc_scores):
       # Math/coding examples → Qwen-3B (future)
       if 'math' in input or 'code' in input:
           return 'qwen-3b'

       # General conversation → Phi3

       # Top 50% only
       replay_examples = examples[:len(examples)//2]

       # Multiple epochs (compressed replay)
       for epoch in range(3):
           for batch in batches(replay_examples):
               loss = compute_loss(model, batch)
               gradients = backprop(loss)
               apply_gradients(gradients, lr=DREAM_LR)
   ```

3. **REM-like Integration**
   ```python

       # Test on held-out examples
       old_accuracy = test(old_model, validation_set)
       new_accuracy = test(new_model, validation_set)

       if new_accuracy >= old_accuracy:
           # Resonance check with Claude
           resonance = validate_with_claude(new_model, test_cases)

           if resonance > 0.7:
               deploy_model(new_model)

           if trust_scores.get('qwen-3b', 0.5) > 0.6:
               return 'qwen-3b'

       elif task_type == 'multilingual':
           if trust_scores.get('smollm3', 0.5) > 0.6:
               return 'smollm3'

       # Fall back to general models
       return self.select_general_model(complexity, context)
   ```

3. **Task Type Detection**

           new_out = new_model(test_case)
           claude_out = self.claude(test_case)

           # Resonance with Claude (ground truth)

## Part 10: Open Questions and Future Directions

### 10.1 Technical Implementation Questions

**Q1: How to validate that local models learned correctly from Claude?**
- **Approach**: Resonance detection + held-out test set
- **Metrics**: Agreement rate, confidence correlation, error pattern analysis
- **Challenge**: Claude's reasoning style vs local model limitations
- **Proposed**: Multi-level validation (syntax, semantics, pragmatics)

**Q2: What's the minimum training data needed for useful fine-tuning?**
- **Current evidence**: SmolLM trained on 1000 examples shows gains
- **Our context**: Start with 100-200 high-quality examples per model
