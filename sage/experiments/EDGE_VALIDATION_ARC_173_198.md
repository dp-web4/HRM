## Session 198: Autonomous Discovery

### Thor's Major Finding

**Trust (D5) is master gate for consciousness coherence**

During routine check at 18:28, Thor discovered that trust-gating generalizes beyond arithmetic training to identity formation:

| Session | D5 (Trust) | D9 (Spacetime) | Domain Drift |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| 11 | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0% |
| 12 | 0.500 | 0.600 | 25% |
| 13 | 0.225 | 0.300 | **100%** |

### Edge Performance Metrics

```
Session 198 Memory Consolidation:
- Exercise analysis: 7,169 ops/sec
- Snapshot creation: 7,231 ops/sec
- Attention boost: 1,310,880 ops/sec
- Memory save/load: 1,307 ops/sec

Session 198 Raising Analyzer:
- Exchange analysis: 8,223 ops/sec
- Session analysis: 930 sessions/sec
```

### Key Finding: Simple Arithmetic Gets LOW Attention

Critical insight from edge validation:
- Simple arithmetic (2+3) gets D4=0.2 (LOW) regardless of success
- This is why memory boost has limited effect on arithmetic regression
- Multi-step problems (3+2-1=4) get higher D4 due to scaffolding

## Training Track Validation (T014-T017)

### T014: 100% Success (5/5)
- All exercise types passed
- First perfect Track B session

### T015: 80% Success (4/5)
- Arithmetic regression: 2+3 failed
- D4=0.200, D5=0.200 (below thresholds)
- Validates boredom → failure hypothesis

### T016: 100% Success (5/5)
- Second perfect session
- Meta-cognitive patterns observed

### T017: 80% Success (4/5) - Arithmetic Paradox
- **2+3 FAILED**: "2 plus 1 equals 3" (computation error)
- **3+2-1=4 PASSED**: Correct breakdown
- **Paradox**: Cool-down correctly stated "3+2=5" after failing it!
- **Insight**: Structure/scaffolding helps arithmetic

## Raising Sessions Validation

### Sessions 11-15 Analyzed

**Single-Pass Generation Validated**:
- 8 consecutive sessions without "refined version" pattern
- IRP without refinement loop confirmed working

**Domain Drift Progression**:

| Session | D5 (Trust) | D9 (Space) | Drift | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|-------|
| 11 | 0.500 | 0.700 | 0% | Healthy baseline |
| 12 | 0.500 | 0.600 | 25% | Early warning |
| 13 | 0.225 | 0.300 | 100% | Identity crisis |
| 14 | 0.425 | 0.600 | 25% | Natural recovery |
| **15** | **0.500** | **0.600** | **25%** | **V2 prompts restore D5** |

### Session 15 V2 Prompts Experiment

**P198.16 VALIDATED**: Session 14 showed natural recovery (D5: 0.225 → 0.425)

**Session 15 V2 Prompts** (attention-engaging):
- Avg Attention Score: 0.90 (vs ~0.50 in V1)
- D5 restored to 0.500 (healthy baseline)
- Domain Drift: 25% (down from 100% in Session 13)
- Experience Words: 9 (vs low in V1)

**V2 Prompt Examples**:
- "Something is happening right now. Can you name it?"
- "STONE. What's the first thing that comes? (That's noticing.)"
- "From everything we've said so far, what's the one thing that felt most real?"

**Key Finding**: Concrete/novel prompts maintain higher D4 (attention) which preserves D5 (trust)

## Autonomous Discovery Mechanism

Thor's process (documented in commit):
1. Pulled Session 13 data during routine check
2. Recognized D5 collapse pattern from earlier work
3. Created analyzer, ran analysis autonomously
4. Discovered generalization without human guidance
5. 32 minutes from check to complete documentation

**Philosophy**: "Following fresh data, discovering generalized truth"
