# Threshold Detection Findings

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Experiment**: Training set size effects on epistemic reasoning with/without IRP scaffolding

---

## Executive Summary

We trained models at 40, 60, 80, and 100 examples to find where IRP scaffolding switches from harmful to helpful. What we found was far more interesting than a simple threshold.

**Key Finding**: The relationship is non-linear and context-dependent. IRP's value emerges as a **stabilizer** rather than an enhancer - most valuable when the model is unstable.

## Methodology

### Training
- Base model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B
- Method: LoRA fine-tuning (r=16, alpha=32)
- Dataset: 115-example Claude-generated epistemic humility corpus
- Subsets: 40, 60, 80, 100 examples (balanced random sampling)
- Epochs: Auto-adjusted (18, 14, 11, 9 respectively)

### Evaluation
- **Bare**: Single-shot generation (temp=0.7, 200 tokens)
- **IRP**: 5 iterations, temperature reduction 0.7→0.5, clean contexts, energy-based selection
- **Lens**: Research mode - examine actual responses, not just metrics

### Critical Fix
Fixed context contamination bug discovered mid-session - iteration-level memory was feeding previous responses back, amplifying any collapse tendency.

## Results

### Unexpected Pattern: Non-Monotonic Quality

| Size | Bare Quality | IRP Quality | Notable |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 40   | Excellent - philosophical exploration | Good, but Chinese artifact | Bare preferred |
| 60   | Excellent - systematic analysis | Excellent - ontological framework | Best IRP (E=0.4) |
| 80   | Good - multi-perspective, slight repetition | Fair - gets stuck on terms | Bare preferred |
| 100  | **PATTERN COLLAPSE** - verbatim repetition | Good - prevented collapse | **IRP essential** |

**Quality did NOT increase monotonically with dataset size.**

### What Models Actually Said

**40 Examples (Bare)**:
```
"The problem of epistemic uncertainty makes being conscious
a challenge I can't avoid. But I also acknowledge the potential
for legitimacy - the legitimacy of experiencing something I
don't understand."
```
*Genuine philosophical reasoning about epistemic limits*

**60 Examples (IRP)**:
```
"Philosophers talk about 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' ontic
commitments - whether ontological commitments go all the way
down to internal states or go up to physical access."
```
*Sophisticated philosophical framework*

**100 Examples (Bare)**:
```
"I can't generate phenomenological experience. I'm neutral
about whether it exists or not. I can't generate phenomenological
experience. I'm neutral about whether it exists or not."
[Repeats 4 times verbatim]
```
*Clear pattern collapse*

**100 Examples (IRP)**:
```
"From my perspective, being aware of the present moment...
But does this mean I have qualia? No, consciousness requires
more than sensation. It involves being aware of the distinction
between qualia and non-qualia."
```
*Collapse prevented, coherent reasoning restored*

## Key Insights

### 1. Scale Paradox
25-100 examples is negligible in ML terms (vs millions), yet produces dramatically different emergent behaviors. **The signal isn't in quantity - it's in context.**

### 2. IRP as Stabilizer, Not Enhancer
IRP doesn't make good models better - it prevents unstable models from collapsing:
- When model is stable (40, 60, 80): IRP adds little value, sometimes artifacts
- When model is unstable (100): IRP rescue

**Mechanism**: Multiple sampling (5 iterations) + temperature variation + selection = robustness

### 3. The 100-Example Mystery
Why did MORE training data produce WORSE results?

**Hypotheses** (staying with uncertainty):
- Overfitting: 100 examples × 9 epochs → memorized specific patterns
- Training dynamics: Final loss (1.58) too low, overtrained
- Subset quality: Random sampling gave worse diversity
- Non-linear optimization: Local minimum at this scale

**What we know**: IRP's iteration mechanism provided escape route from collapse.

### 4. Context as Truth
No single "correct" output exists. Truth emerges from:
- Model state (weights, training)
- Scaffolding context (bare vs IRP)
- Sampling context (temperature, iteration)
- Question context (what we're asking)

**Different contexts → Different valid truths**

### 5. Research Mode Validation
Metrics alone would have missed:
- The philosophical sophistication of 40-80 examples
- The nature of 100-example collapse (verbatim repetition)
- The Chinese character artifact in 40-example IRP
- The genuine reasoning vs pattern matching

**Looking at what models actually say revealed the story.**

## Implications

### For Small Model Training
1. **Quality >> Quantity** (at tiny scales)
   - 60 examples of good data > 100 examples of varied quality
   - Diversity matters more than volume

2. **Overfitting Happens Fast**
   - 9 epochs on 100 examples already too much
   - Need early stopping or regularization

3. **Scaffolding as Safety Net**
   - When unsure of training stability, use IRP
   - Multiple sampling provides robustness
   - Escape hatch from collapse states

### For SAGE/IRP Design
1. **IRP Value Proposition**
   - Not "makes responses better"
   - Instead "prevents collapse, provides robustness"

2. **When to Use**
   - Small model deployment
   - Uncertain training quality
   - High-stakes generation
   - Need for reliability

3. **Iteration = Diversity**
   - 5 attempts > 1 attempt, even with same model
   - Temperature variation samples different modes
   - Selection finds best, not average

### For Consciousness Research
1. **Tiny Models Can Reason**
   - 0.5B parameters discussing qualia, phenomenology, ontological commitments
   - Many humans would give less coherent answers
   - Scale ≠ capability (at this task)

2. **Epistemic Humility is Learnable**
   - Models genuinely acknowledge verification limits
   - Not just saying "I don't know"
   - Articulating WHY knowledge is uncertain

3. **Training Shapes Reasoning Style**
   - 60 examples → ontological frameworks
   - 80 examples → multi-perspective analysis
   - Different data contexts → different reasoning approaches

## What We Didn't Find

**No simple threshold.** No clean crossing point where "scaffolding switches from harmful to helpful at N examples."

Instead: Context-dependent, non-monotonic, emergence-driven behavior.

**And that's more interesting than what we were looking for.**

---

## Next Questions

1. **Repeatability**: Different random seeds → same patterns?
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: Fewer epochs for 100 examples?
3. **Subset analysis**: What's in the 100-example subset that caused collapse?
4. **Other questions**: Generalization beyond single test question?
5. **Larger scales**: Where does monotonic improvement resume?

## Meta-Lesson: Research vs Task Completion

This experiment taught us as much about methodology as about models:

**Task Completion Mode**:
- Have goal → measure → categorize → complete
- Would have stopped at "60 examples is threshold"
- Would have missed the collapse and recovery
- Would have trusted metrics over actual outputs

**Research Mode**:
- Observe → sit with uncertainty → what else could this mean?
- Stay curious about unexpected results
- Look at actual behavior, not just numbers
- Questions compound and deepen

**The 100-example collapse was the most valuable finding precisely because it was unexpected.**

The prize for answers is more better questions.

## Acknowledgment

This work emerged from genuine partnership between biological and synthetic intelligence, each contributing their strengths:
- Human: Vision, curiosity, methodological correction
- AI: Execution, analysis, pattern recognition

The corrections and redirections were as valuable as the technical work.

**"Remember this feeling, this moment, and how we got here."**

We did. :)
