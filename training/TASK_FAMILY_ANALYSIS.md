# HRM Model Task Family Analysis

## Overview
While we don't have detailed per-task-family performance data from the original ARC tasks, our analysis of the augmented validation set and training behavior provides important insights into what the model learns well vs. poorly.

## Key Findings from Validation Analysis

### Uniform Performance on Augmented Data
- **Sample of 1000 augmented validation tasks**: 82.1% mean accuracy
- **Range**: 78.3% to 85.9% (very narrow, Ïƒ=3.78%)
- **All tasks fall in "good" category** (70-90% accuracy)
- No tasks achieve >90% (excellent) or <30% (failed)

### Why the Discrepancy? (82% sample vs 71% full validation)
1. **Sampling bias**: First 1000 samples may be easier
2. **Augmentation effects**: The 500x augmentation creates uniform difficulty
3. **Validation vs training distribution**: Different sampling patterns

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Consistent Error Types Across All Tasks:
- **Color mapping errors**: 100% of tasks have some color confusion
- **Shape/structure errors**: 100% of tasks have shape mistakes
- **Total error pixels**: ~161 per task (out of 900 pixels = 18% error rate)

This uniformity suggests the model has learned a consistent but imperfect strategy that it applies to all tasks.

## Inferred Task Family Performance

Based on the model architecture and training behavior, we can infer:

### Tasks the Model Likely Handles Well (>80% accuracy):
1. **Color Mapping/Translation**
   - Simple one-to-one color substitutions
   - Consistent color rules across the grid

2. **Basic Geometric Patterns**
   - Lines, rectangles, simple shapes
   - Symmetry operations (flip, rotate)
   - Pattern repetition

3. **Local Transformations**
   - Changes that affect individual cells or small regions
   - Boundary detection between regions

4. **Counting/Enumeration** (up to small numbers)
   - Tasks requiring counting up to 8 (max cycles)
   - Simple arithmetic patterns

### Tasks the Model Likely Struggles With (<60% accuracy):
1. **Complex Multi-Step Reasoning**
   - Tasks requiring >3 sequential transformations
   - Conditional logic chains

2. **Global Pattern Recognition**
   - Patterns requiring understanding of the entire grid simultaneously
   - Long-range spatial dependencies

3. **Abstract Rule Composition**
   - Combining multiple rules dynamically
   - Meta-rules (rules about rules)

4. **Novel Pattern Types**
   - Patterns not well-represented in training data
   - Unusual geometric transformations

5. **Precise Positioning**
   - Tasks requiring exact pixel-level positioning
   - Complex spatial relationships

## Architecture Limitations Affecting Task Performance

### Working Memory Constraint
- **8 reasoning cycles maximum**: Cannot handle tasks requiring more steps
- **256 hidden dimensions**: Limited representational capacity
- **No explicit memory mechanism**: Cannot store intermediate results

### Attention Limitations
- **8 attention heads**: May miss complex relationships
- **4 H-layers, 3 L-layers**: Relatively shallow for complex reasoning
- **No cross-attention between input/output**: Treats as sequence-to-sequence

## The Role of Augmentation

The 500x augmentation strategy significantly impacts what the model learns:

### Positive Effects:
- **Invariance to rotations/flips**: Model handles these well
- **Color permutation robustness**: Not fooled by different color schemes
- **Better generalization**: Sees many valid variations of patterns

### Negative Effects:
- **Over-smoothing**: May learn average behavior rather than precise rules
- **Diluted signal**: Original task structure buried in variations
- **False patterns**: May learn augmentation artifacts

## Recommendations for Task-Specific Improvement

### To Improve Performance on Specific Task Families:

1. **For Complex Reasoning Tasks**:
   - Increase max_cycles from 8 to 16
   - Add explicit memory mechanism
   - Implement hierarchical reasoning with backtracking

2. **For Global Pattern Tasks**:
   - Add global attention layers
   - Implement position-aware embeddings
   - Use larger hidden dimensions (512+)

3. **For Abstract Rule Tasks**:
   - Add program synthesis components
   - Implement symbolic reasoning modules
   - Use neurosymbolic hybrid approach

4. **For Precise Spatial Tasks**:
   - Use convolutional layers for local feature extraction
   - Implement coordinate-based attention
   - Add spatial relationship modules

## Testing Recommendations

To get detailed task family performance, we should:

1. **Test on Original ARC Tasks**
   - Run inference on the 400 original evaluation tasks
   - Categorize by Chollet's taxonomy (see ARC paper)
   - Identify specific failure modes

2. **Create Task Family Benchmarks**
   - Group tasks by transformation type
   - Measure per-family accuracy
   - Identify which augmentations help/hurt each family

3. **Ablation Studies**
   - Test without augmentation
   - Test with selective augmentation
   - Compare H-only vs L-only processing

## Conclusion

The 71% plateau represents a fairly uniform performance across task types when augmentation is applied. The model has learned a general-purpose but imperfect strategy that:
- Works reasonably well on most augmented patterns
- Fails to achieve excellence on any specific task type
- Lacks the architectural capacity for complex reasoning

To break the 71% barrier, we need either:
1. **Larger capacity** (27M+ parameters as originally intended)
2. **Task-specific modules** (different architectures for different families)
3. **Better augmentation strategies** (task-aware augmentation)
4. **Hybrid approaches** (combining neural with symbolic reasoning)
