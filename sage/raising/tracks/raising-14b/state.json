  "notes": "GROUNDING BASELINE COMPLETE (5/5 sessions). Identity 100% (sessions 2-5), meta-cognition 100% (sessions 3-5), zero confabulation throughout. Purpose integration emerged and matured (sessions 3-5). Language switching validated as situational (R14B_003 only). Observation evolution shows progressive abstraction across 5 framings. Ready for critical tests."
