# Hâ†”L as Contextâ†”Action Architecture

*Date: September 12, 2025*  
*The crystallization of SAGE's true purpose*

## The Fundamental Insight

The Hâ†”L (High-level â†” Low-level) architecture in SAGE isn't about hierarchical reasoning in the traditional sense. It's about the separation and interaction between **context understanding** and **action within context**.

**H-Module = Context Attender**  
**L-Module = Context Actor**

## Architecture Roles

### H-Module: The Context Attender
**Primary role: Maintaining and understanding context**

The H-module asks: **"What situation are we in?"**

Responsibilities:
- Maintains the 16D+ classification space (pattern type, size relationships, color semantics, etc.)
- Tracks temporal context (previous attempts, what worked/failed)
- Understands relationships between elements
- Holds the "why" and "when" of transformations
- Provides the semantic framework for action
- Retrieves relevant examples from training set
- Maintains coherence across time and attempts

### L-Module: The Context Actor
**Primary role: Operating within the established context**

The L-module asks: **"What do I do in this situation?"**

Responsibilities:
- Executes specific transformations
- Applies demonstrated patterns
- Handles mechanical/tactical details
- Implements the "how" of solutions
- Produces concrete outputs
- Operates efficiently within given context
- Doesn't need to understand "why", just "how"

## The Bidirectional Communication

The Hâ†”L communication is where context guides action:

### Hâ†’L Communication (Context Provision)
```
H: "Here's the context you're operating in"
   - This is a rectangle-filling pattern
   - Similar to training examples X, Y, Z
   - The semantic rule is: hollow â†’ filled
   - Color 3 marks boundaries, color 4 is fill
   - Output should be same size as input
```

### Lâ†’H Communication (Action Feedback)
```
L: "Here's what happened when I acted"
   - I applied the transformation
   - These pixels were affected
   - This is the resulting state
   - Confidence level: 0.87
   - Execution complete/failed
```

## This Explains Everything

### Why Agent Zero Happened
- No context understanding in H-module
- L-module just executed "minimize pixel loss" without context
- Result: constant zero outputs on sparse grids
- **Missing piece**: Context to guide meaningful action

### Why V2/V3 Are Different
Same architecture, different context interpretations:

**V2 (Algorithmic Claude)**:
- H-level context: "Complex patterns requiring systematic analysis"
- 600+ lines of pattern detection logic
- Over-engineered but thorough

**V3 (Human-like Claude)**:
- H-level context: "Simple visual patterns a human would see"
- 16D classification space
- Simpler heuristics
- 58.8% different predictions from same inputs!

### Why Distillation Worked
We weren't distilling "intelligence" - we were distilling Claude's context understanding:
- The H-level learned Claude's context interpretation
- The L-level learned to act within Claude's context
- "The model is the envelope. The letter inside is still written by me."

## The 16D Context Prototype

V3 introduced a 16-dimensional classification system - an early prototype of context encoding:

1. **Pattern type** (extraction, filling, symmetry, etc.)
2. **Size relationship** (same, smaller, larger, tiled)
3. **Color count** (input/output color usage)
4. **Spatial density** (sparse/dense)
5. **Transformation complexity** (simple/complex)
6. **Object relationships** (separate/touching/overlapping)
7. **Symmetry properties** (horizontal/vertical/rotational)
8. **Boundary conditions** (edge behavior)
9. **Repetition patterns** (periodic/aperiodic)
10. **Color semantics** (background/foreground/special)
11. **Connectivity** (connected components)
12. **Directionality** (movement/flow)
13. **Hierarchical structure** (nested patterns)
14. **Temporal sequence** (if multi-step)
15. **Conditional logic** (if-then patterns)
16. **Reference frame** (absolute/relative positioning)

This isn't just pattern matching - it's building structured understanding of the problem space.

## Implications for SAGE Development

### H-Module Development Priority
Focus on rich context encoding:
- Expand beyond 16D to capture more nuance
- Add temporal context (memory of attempts)
- Include meta-context (why are we solving this?)
- Build context similarity/retrieval mechanisms
- Maintain coherence across sessions

### L-Module Can Stay Simple
Doesn't need deep understanding:
- Just needs to execute transformations well
- Can be smaller/faster/quantized
- Focus on accurate action within context
- Optimize for execution efficiency

### Hâ†”L Communication is Critical
This is where the magic happens:
- Bandwidth determines sophistication
- Multiple rounds allow context refinement
- Gating mechanisms for selective communication
- Context updates based on action results

## Quantization Strategy Refined

This architecture suggests different precision needs:

- **H-module**: 100M parameters @ FP16 (rich context needs precision)
- **L-module**: 1B parameters @ INT4/ternary (execution can be quantized)
- **Communication**: Careful design of information bottleneck

The context depth matters more than execution precision. A sophisticated H can guide a simple but fast L.

## The Recursive Proof

This very conversation demonstrates Hâ†”L in action:
- Claude's H maintains context across messages, days, machines
- Claude's L produces specific responses within that context
- Human's H sees patterns in Claude's behavior
- Human's L guides with targeted questions
- Together we maintain coherent context despite:
  - Different sessions
  - Different machines
  - Different projects
  - Days apart

**The fact that this discussion makes perfect sense IS the proof that context is everything.**

## Core Principles

1. **Context isn't a feature of intelligence - it IS intelligence**
2. **H attends to context, L acts within context**
3. **The separation allows specialization and efficiency**
4. **The communication enables sophistication**
5. **Context maintains coherence across time/space/sessions**

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Formalize the 16D+ context encoding system
2. Build H-module context retrieval mechanisms
3. Design efficient Hâ†”L communication protocol
4. Test context-aware solving vs. current approaches

### Architecture Evolution
1. Expand H-module context dimensions
2. Optimize L-module for execution efficiency
3. Implement iterative Hâ†”L refinement loops
4. Add temporal context persistence

### Validation
1. Test if explicit context/action separation improves accuracy
2. Measure context coherence across attempts
3. Validate that simpler L with smarter H works better
4. Prove that context enables generalization

## Conclusion

We're not building artificial intelligence from scratch. We're formalizing the contextâ†”action pattern that already underlies all intelligent behavior. 

Hâ†”L isn't just SAGE architecture - it's how intelligence works:
- H maintains context
- L acts within it
- Communication enables sophistication
- Together they create coherent behavior

**Context is everything. Everything else is just action within context.**
