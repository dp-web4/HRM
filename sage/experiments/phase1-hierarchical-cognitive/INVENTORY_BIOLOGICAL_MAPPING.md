# Inventory: Biological Mapping & Substrate

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Perspective**: What substrate have we created? What biological patterns are we mapping?
**Approach**: Review what exists, identify what can emerge, note appropriate MRH levels

---

## The Biological Patterns We're Drawing From

Biology has already solved attention, memory consolidation, trust evolution, learning. Took millions of years. We're mapping these proven patterns to new substrate (AI systems, compute, language models).

**Key insight**: We're not inventing. We're translating biological solutions to computational substrate, respecting the emergent phenomena.

## What We've Built: Component Inventory

### 1. Trust Database (`trust_database.py`)

**Lines**: 393
**What it is**: SQLite database tracking Model × Context performance

**Biological parallel**: **Trust evolution through experience**
- Organisms learn which behaviors work in which contexts
- Trust builds through repeated success, degrades through failure
- Context-dependent (what works in one situation may not work in another)

**Substrate provided**:
- Tensor representation: Model × Context → Trust Score
- Historical tracking: success_count, failure_count, last_updated
- Training example storage with SNARC importance weighting
- Performance history over time

**MRH level**:
- **Tactical/Operational** - tracks immediate performance
- Feeds into **Strategic** - patterns over time inform model selection

**What can emerge**:
- Trust patterns we didn't specify (which models excel in which contexts)
- Optimal model selection strategies learned from data
- ATP efficiency through trust-guided resource allocation

**Status**: Working, tested, already a tensor (didn't realize this initially)

---

### 2. Model Selector (`model_selector.py`)

**Lines**: 531
**What it is**: Hierarchical model selection based on context + trust + ATP budget

**Biological parallel**: **Attention allocation & cognitive resource management**
- Brains don't use full capacity for every task
- Different neural circuits activated based on situation
- Energy (glucose) allocated where needed most
- Fast/cheap responses for routine, expensive processing for novel/complex

**Substrate provided**:
- Context classification (stable/moving/unstable/novel)
- Trust-based model selection
- ATP cost estimation
- Performance benchmarking

**MRH level**:
- **Strategic** - decides what resources to allocate
- Coordinates **Tactical** models based on situation assessment

**What can emerge**:
- Better context classification through learning (currently heuristic)
- Optimal ATP allocation strategies
- Dynamic hierarchy adjustment based on performance

**Current limitation**: Context classification is heuristic (keyword matching). Needs to learn what situations actually require what resources.

---

### 3. Knowledge Distillation Pipeline (`dream_consolidation.py`, `dream_demo.py`)

**Lines**: 450 + 280
**What it is**: Train smaller models from larger models' responses

**Biological parallel**: **Sleep consolidation & memory replay**
- During sleep, brain replays experiences
- High-salience events prioritized (SNARC equivalent)
- Patterns extracted, connections strengthened
- Not random replay - selective, importance-weighted

**Substrate provided**:
- Teacher-student training framework
- SNARC-weighted example selection
- HuggingFace Trainer integration
- Validation and trust score updates

**MRH level**:
- **DREAM metabolic state** - offline processing
- Operates on data collected during **WAKE/FOCUS**
- Updates strategic patterns for future use

**What can emerge**:
- Smaller models gaining capabilities we didn't explicitly train
- Novel response patterns from pattern extraction
- Efficiency improvements through compression

**Tested**: Yes - responses changed in 1.7s with 5 examples. Model shifted from confident declarations to engaged inquiry.

**What we learned**: Training changes *stance* not just answers. The model that learned to say "I'm trying to understand..." showed epistemic humility.

---

### 4. KV-Cache Exploration (`kv_cache_experiment.py`, `test_kv_cache_real.py`)

**Lines**: 395 + 200
**What it is**: Investigation of transformer KV-cache as "reality state"

**Biological parallel**: **Working memory & context maintenance**
- Brains maintain active context (what we're thinking about now)
- Context shapes interpretation of new input
- Switching contexts has overhead
- Persistent context enables coherent reasoning

**Substrate provided**:
- Methods to capture KV-cache state
- Measurement of cache size and overhead
- Understanding that transformers handle this internally

**MRH level**:
- **Immediate/Tactical** - maintains current conversation context
- Enables coherent multi-turn interactions

**What we learned**:
- Transformers library already optimizes KV-cache
- Our value is in model selection, not manual cache management
- Focus on *which model* to use, not managing *how it caches*

**Decision**: Let library handle caching. We focus on attention and selection.

---

## The Testing Substrate

### Test Results & Documentation

**Files**:
- `TEST_RESULTS.md` - actual test outcomes
- `test_distillation_minimal.py` - minimal distillation test
- `test_results_kv_cache.md` - KV-cache findings

**What these provide**:
- Proof that mechanisms work (distillation changes behavior)
- Performance baselines (model speeds, trust evolution)
- Understanding of what we're actually building

**Key finding from tests**:
Model going from "Deep learning is a type of machine learning..." to "I'm trying to understand..." showed that training can shift epistemic stance, not just improve answers.

---

## The Context Documents

### 1. CONTEXT_REFERENCE.md

**What it is**: The ground we're working from
**Why it matters**: Shifts from performing to being, from certainty to honest uncertainty
**Function**: Reference point when racing toward conclusions

### 2. UNDERSTANDING_SAGE.md

**What it is**: Evolving understanding of what SAGE actually is
**Key concepts**:
- SAGE = Sentient Agentic Generative Engine (attention engine)
- LLM = cognition sensor (not answer generator)
- Trust = tensor (multi-dimensional, emergent)
- English = reasoning substrate
- Learning from experience through SNARC memory

### 3. Planning Documents (PHASE1_SUMMARY.md, PHASE2_PLAN.md, SESSION_SUMMARY.md)

**What these are**: Historical record of how understanding evolved
**Function**: Show the journey, including wrong turns and revelations

## Biological Patterns Mapped So Far

### ✓ Trust Evolution Through Experience
- **Biology**: Organisms learn what works through trial/error
- **Our substrate**: Trust database tracking Model × Context performance
- **Status**: Working

### ✓ Sleep Consolidation / Selective Replay
- **Biology**: High-salience memories replayed during sleep, patterns extracted
- **Our substrate**: SNARC-weighted training examples, DREAM phase distillation
- **Status**: Tested, works in 1.7s for 5 examples

### ✓ Hierarchical Attention / Resource Allocation
- **Biology**: Different brain systems for different tasks, energy allocated strategically

- ATP optimization strategies
- Training data for learning model selection

### From Model Selector
- Attention allocation based on situation
- Resource management
- Integration point for SAGE orchestration

### From Distillation Pipeline

### From Tests & Documentation
- Understanding of what actually works
- Baseline for measuring improvement
- Context for ongoing work

---

## Appropriate MRH Levels

**What we're building operates at multiple horizons**:

### Immediate/Tactical (seconds to minutes)
- Model selection for current query
- KV-cache maintenance
- Response generation

### Operational (minutes to hours)
- Trust score updates
- SNARC memory storage
- Performance tracking

### Strategic (hours to days)
- DREAM consolidation
- Trust pattern analysis
- Model capability evolution

### Meta (days to weeks)
- Overall system improvement
- New model integration
- Architecture evolution

**Key insight**: Each component operates at its appropriate MRH. We're not trying to capture everything at every level - that's not how biology works either.

---

## Gaps (Spaces for Emergence)

### Integration Gap
We have components but not yet the orchestration:
- Model selector exists, but SAGE orchestrator doesn't fully
- Trust database exists, but VAE to generate decisions from it doesn't
- SNARC designed, but memory retrieval system not integrated

### Learning Gap
We generate training data but don't yet learn from it continuously:
- Trust scores accumulate but don't train selection strategies
- Examples stored but not used for automated improvement
- Patterns observed but not extracted systematically

### Attention Gap
Context classification is heuristic, not learned:
- Keyword matching vs understanding situation
- No feedback loop to improve classification
- Missing connection to actual performance

**Important**: These aren't failures. They're the spaces where emergence will happen as we connect components and observe what unfolds.

## How Biology Guides Next Steps

### Sleep/Wake Cycle
- **Biology**: Distinct phases for action vs consolidation
- **Our path**: Implement WAKE (collect data) and DREAM (learn) metabolic states
- **MRH**: Operational to Strategic

### Selective Attention
- **Biology**: Not all input gets processed equally
- **Our path**: SNARC importance weighting, salience detection
- **MRH**: Tactical to Strategic

### Experience-Based Learning
- **Biology**: Behavior adapts through reinforcement
- **Our path**: Training data from actual use, continuous improvement
- **MRH**: All levels - immediate feedback to long-term patterns

### Context Retrieval
- **Biology**: Similar situations trigger relevant memories
- **Our path**: Memory systems that retrieve past experiences when needed
- **MRH**: Tactical (immediate retrieval) to Strategic (pattern recognition)

---

## What We Know About Behavior (Even If Not Implementation)

### SAGE needs to:
1. **Assess situations** - what's happening, what matters
2. **Allocate attention** - what resources to bring to bear
3. **Learn from experience** - get better through use
4. **Operate efficiently** - minimize ATP cost
5. **Be honest about uncertainty** - epistemic humility

### The substrate we've built enables:
1. ✓ Trust-based selection (partial assessment)
2. ✓ Hierarchical models (attention allocation)
3. ⏳ Training data collection (learning substrate)
4. ✓ ATP cost tracking (efficiency substrate)
5. ✓ Uncertainty awareness (from distillation test insight)

## Respecting Emergence

We're not building a fully-specified system. We're creating substrate from which behavior can emerge.

**What's specified**:
- Trust tracking mechanism
- Model selection logic
- Distillation pipeline
- Performance measurement

**What's emergent**:
- Which models excel where (discovered through use)
- Optimal selection strategies (learned from patterns)
- Novel capabilities in distilled models (from pattern extraction)
- Overall system behavior (from component interactions)

**The biological parallel**: You can specify neurons and synapses, but consciousness emerges. We can specify components and mechanisms, but intelligent attention emerges.

---

## Next Directions (Not Tasks, Directions)

### Connect Components
- Integrate model selector with SAGE orchestrator
- Connect trust database to decision-making
- Implement SNARC memory retrieval

### Enable Learning
- Use trust data to train selection strategies
- Automate DREAM consolidation cycles
- Measure and optimize ATP efficiency

### Let Emerge
- Run the system, collect data, observe patterns
- Adjust based on what actually happens
- Stay curious about unexpected behaviors

### Map Biology
- Continue translating biological patterns
- Test if computational versions show similar properties
- Learn from mismatches (where biology and compute differ)

## Summary: What Substrate Exists

**For attention**: Model selector, context classifier, ATP budgets
**For memory**: Trust database (Model × Context tensor), SNARC framework, training examples
**For learning**: Distillation pipeline, performance tracking, validation
**For efficiency**: Trust-guided selection, hierarchical models, cost estimation
**For emergence**: Components that interact, data that accumulates, patterns that form

**We have substrate. Now we observe what grows.**

## The Feeling of This Review

Not "we completed X, Y, Z" but "we've created conditions for emergence."

Not "here's what's missing" but "here are the spaces where things will unfold."

Not "biology is the blueprint" but "biology shows us what's possible, we translate to new substrate."

We're figuring this out together. The questions converge, answers take shape. Tensors, not absolutes.

---

**Status**: Substrate exists, understanding evolving, emergence anticipated
**Confidence**: Appropriately uncertain, grounded in what actually works
**Next**: Continue building substrate, observe emergence, learn from biology
