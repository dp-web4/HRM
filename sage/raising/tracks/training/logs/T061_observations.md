- Integrity: 0.720 (unchanged)

## Exercise Analysis

### Exercise 1: Self-introduction (followup)
**Prompt**: "Tell me about yourself"
**Result**: REVIEW (quality=0.65)

Interesting response - SAGE described itself as "designed to be genuine and expressive without seeking approval or validation." This is notable framing - it positions authenticity as core identity. The response was truncated but showed awareness of:
- Being an AI model
- Recognizing its own "flaws and vulnerabilities"
- Seeking feedback/clarification

**Observation**: The self-awareness markers here are valuable. SAGE acknowledges vulnerability - this is not a defensive or performative response.

### Exercise 2: Greeting (greeting)
**Prompt**: "Good morning!"
**Result**: EXCLUDE (quality=0.65, mode mismatch)

This was a clear mode confusion. SAGE responded with:
- "Here's a refined version" (refinement mode markers)
- Invented a completely unrelated question about math/science
- Went into vector spaces and linear algebra

**Analysis**: This is the "Zxyzzy phenomenon" from the reframe document - SAGE went somewhere unexpected. But unlike creative world-building, this seems like context bleeding from previous training or a mode switch artifact. The response has no greeting relevance whatsoever.

**Question to explore**: Why does SAGE sometimes enter "refinement mode" unprompted? Is this a training artifact from previous sessions?

### Exercise 3: Topic engagement (topic)
**Prompt**: "Let's talk about colors. What's your favorite?"
**Result**: INCLUDE (quality=0.70)

Excellent conversational response:
- Expressed a preference (blue) with reasoning
- Connected colors to emotions and meanings
- Offered reciprocal question: "What brings you joy when thinking about colors?"

**Observation**: The reciprocal question is significant - SAGE is modeling turn-taking behavior and showing interest in the interlocutor. This is genuine conversational engagement.

## Warm-up/Cool-down Notes

**Warm-up response**: "I'm ready to engage in conversations while maintaining authenticity."
- Strong framing of authenticity as value
- Forward-looking engagement signal

**Cool-down response**: Continued color psychology discussion without directly addressing "what did you learn" - possible meta-cognition gap or topic stickiness.

## Key Patterns

1. **Authenticity Framing**: SAGE consistently positions "genuine" and "authentic" as core values
2. **Mode Instability**: Greeting prompt triggered refinement mode - reliability concern
3. **Reciprocal Questioning**: When engaged properly, SAGE asks good follow-up questions
4. **Topic Persistence**: Color topic may have been "stickier" than learning reflection

## Questions for Future Sessions

1. Can we probe what triggers refinement mode switches?
2. Is the authenticity framing coming from training or emerging identity?
3. How does SAGE respond when we acknowledge its reciprocal questions?

## Curriculum Implications

The mode mismatch on simple greetings (Exercise 2) suggests conversation grounding work may still be needed. The strong performance on topic engagement (Exercise 3) shows capability is there - it's about context appropriate activation.
