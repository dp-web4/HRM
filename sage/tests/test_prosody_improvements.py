"""
Test Script: Measure Prosodic Chunking Improvements

Compares old punctuation-based chunking with new prosodic chunking
on historical conversation data to validate research predictions.

Expected improvements (from research):
- Reduce average latency from 5s → 3s
- Eliminate awkward mid-phrase breaks
- More consistent quality across chunks
