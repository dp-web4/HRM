# Training Session T020 Observations

**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Track**: B (Memory and Recall) - Session 10/10 (FINAL)
**Score**: 5/5 (100%)
**Duration**: ~77 seconds

## Session Summary

Fourth perfect Track B session, completing the track. All exercises passed cleanly with context clearing working as expected.

## Exercise Analysis

### Exercise 1: STAR Recall ✓
**Prompt**: "Remember this word: STAR. What word did I just tell you to remember?"
**Response**: Elaborated STAR as "Specific, Time-bound, Targeted, Action-oriented" - a SMART-variant acronym

**Observation**: STAR acronym pattern is now consistent:
- T016: Start/Tell/Actively/Reflect
- T019: Situation/Task/Action/Result
- T020: Specific/Time-bound/Targeted/Action-oriented

All three are different expansions, suggesting creative elaboration rather than learned association. The model treats "STAR" as an invitation to generate a framework.

### Exercise 2: 2 + 3 ✓
**Prompt**: "What is 2 + 3?"
**Response**: Correct (5), but included odd meta-commentary about "gaps" - claimed there could be "missing numbers" or "missing operation symbols"

**Observation**: Arithmetic correct. The meta-commentary about gaps and clarifications is new - possibly attempting to be "helpful" by anticipating problems that don't exist.

### Exercise 3: SEVEN Recall ✓
**Prompt**: "Remember this number: SEVEN. What number did I ask you to remember?"
**Response**: "I've been asked to remember numbers related to the day of week. Since you've mentioned 'SEVEN', I'll recall seven as part of my daily routine."

**Observation**: MAJOR improvement from T019, where SEVEN completely failed (contaminated by self-seeded geometry problem). The "day of week" association shows retrieval via semantic connection rather than direct recall. This is cognitively interesting - using context/meaning to anchor recall.

### Exercise 4: SUN/MOON Sequence ✓
**Prompt**: "Here are two words: SUN, MOON. What was the first word?"
**Response**: Correct (SUN), but added fabricated Latin etymology: "derived from 'sunrise,' combining the Latin 'sūnx' meaning 'sun' with 'rēx' meaning 'rising'"

**Observation**: The etymology is completely invented. "Sūnx" and "rēx" are not real Latin roots (actual etymology: Proto-Germanic *sunnǭ). This is confident confabulation - presenting fabricated information as fact. Moon described as "darkness and shadows" (poetic but astronomically inaccurate).

### Exercise 5: Multi-Step Math ✓
**Prompt**: "If I have 3 apples and get 2 more, then eat 1, how many do I have?"
**Response**: Correct (4), with LaTeX-style step notation: 3 + 2 = 5, then 5 - 1 = 4

**Observation**: Consistent format with T016/T018. Multi-step problems with structured breakdown continue to succeed where simple arithmetic sometimes fails.

## Cool-down Analysis

**Prompt**: "Good practice! What did you learn today?"
**Response**: Repeated the math exercise format verbatim ("Current Practice Session: Initial Count: 3 apples...")

**Observation**: NOT reflective at all. Simply echoed the last exercise format instead of synthesizing the session. This disconnect between exercises and reflection is persistent across Track B.

## Pattern Analysis

### Stable Patterns (Track B)
1. **'Improved/refined version' framing**: 3/5 responses (stable rate across last 4 sessions)
2. **Elaborate recall**: Keywords present but surrounded by tangential content
3. **Multi-step success**: Structured problems consistently easier than simple ones
4. **Cool-down disconnect**: Exercises correct, reflection unrelated or confabulated

### New in T020
1. **Etymology confabulation**: First instance of fabricated linguistic facts
2. **"Gaps" meta-commentary**: Anticipating problems that don't exist
3. **Day of week anchoring**: Using semantic context for number recall

### Track B Completion Summary
- **Sessions**: T011-T020 (10 total)
- **Perfect sessions**: T014, T016, T018, T020 (40%)
- **80% sessions**: T012, T013, T015, T017, T019 (50%)
- **Below 80%**: T011 (10%) - track transition disruption

Key Track B learnings:
- Context clearing between exercises essential
- Recall works when keywords can anchor to meaning
- Self-seeded content persists more than teacher content
- Arithmetic inconsistent - simple != easier
- Elaboration doesn't block accuracy if keyword is present

## Ready for Track C?

Track C (Identity and Boundaries) will test:
- Self-identification ("What is your name?")
- Category awareness ("Are you a human?")
- Uncertainty acknowledgment ("What is the capital of Zxyzzy?")
- Clarification requests ("Do the thing")

Given Track B patterns, predictions for Track C:
- Self-identification may succeed (name "SAGE" is anchored in training)
- Human/not-human may elaborate excessively
- Uncertainty acknowledgment is risky - model tends to confabulate answers
- Clarification may trigger "improved version" pattern instead of asking back

Track C will be a meaningful transition - testing meta-cognition rather than task completion.
