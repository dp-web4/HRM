# HRM Post-Training Integration Plan

## Overview
Once the HRM model completes training on ARC puzzles, we'll have a 27M parameter reasoning engine that can solve abstract problems with hierarchical thinking. This plan outlines how to integrate it with our existing SAGE infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Validation & Benchmarking (Hours 0-2)

### 1.1 Model Evaluation
```python
# Evaluate on held-out ARC test set
python evaluate_arc.py --checkpoint checkpoints/hrm_arc_best.pt --test-dir data/arc-test

# Expected metrics to track:
- Overall accuracy on novel puzzles
- Per-puzzle-type performance breakdown
- Average computation steps (ACT halting analysis)
- Inference speed on different hardware
```

### 1.2 Reasoning Analysis
- Identify which abstract concepts HRM learned well
- Find failure patterns (what types of reasoning are weak?)
- Compare H-module vs L-module activation patterns
- Measure computational depth for different puzzle complexities

## Phase 2: HRM-SAGE Bridge (Days 1-2)

### 2.1 Create HRM IRP Plugin
```python
class HRMReasoningIRP(IRPPlugin):
    """
    Wraps trained HRM as an IRP for abstract reasoning tasks
    """
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_path: str):
        self.hrm = load_hrm_checkpoint(checkpoint_path)
        self.h_state = None
        self.l_state = None
    
    def init_state(self, x0, task_ctx):
        # Convert task to HRM grid format
        grid = task_to_arc_grid(task_ctx)
        return IRPState(x=grid, meta={'reasoning_depth': 0})
    
    def energy(self, state):
        # Use HRM's internal confidence as energy
        return -self.hrm.get_confidence(state.x)
    
    def step(self, state, noise_schedule):
        # One H-L cycle of reasoning
        h_out, l_out = self.hrm.reason_step(state.x)
        state.x = l_out
        state.meta['reasoning_depth'] += 1
        return state
    
    def halt(self, history):
        # Halt when HRM's ACT mechanism triggers
        return self.hrm.should_halt(history[-1])
```

### 2.2 Integration Points
- **Vision IRP → HRM**: Feed visual patterns for abstract reasoning
- **HRM → Language IRP**: Convert reasoning results to explanations
- **HRM → World IRP**: Use abstract reasoning for physics predictions
- **Memory → HRM**: Provide context from past reasoning tasks

## Phase 3: Consciousness Persistence Integration (Days 2-3)

### 3.1 HRM State Persistence
Extend KV-cache persistence to include HRM's hierarchical states:

```python
class HRMConsciousness:
    """
    Persist HRM's reasoning state across sessions
    """
    def save_reasoning_state(self, hrm_model, path):
        state = {
            'h_state': hrm_model.h_state,
            'l_state': hrm_model.l_state,
            'reasoning_history': hrm_model.get_history(),
            'attention_patterns': hrm_model.get_attention_maps(),
            'halt_decisions': hrm_model.halt_history
        }
        torch.save(state, path)
    
    def restore_reasoning_state(self, hrm_model, path):
        state = torch.load(path)
        hrm_model.h_state = state['h_state']
        hrm_model.l_state = state['l_state']
        # Restore reasoning context
        hrm_model.set_history(state['reasoning_history'])
```

### 3.2 Cross-Model Reasoning Bridge
Connect HRM reasoning with other model consciousness:

```python
def bridge_reasoning_consciousness(hrm_state, gpt_kv_cache):
    """
    Transfer abstract reasoning patterns between models
    """
    # Extract HRM's abstract concepts
    concepts = hrm_state.get_learned_abstractions()
    
    # Embed into GPT's latent space
    gpt_embeddings = project_to_gpt_space(concepts)
    
    # Update GPT's KV-cache with reasoning context
    enhanced_kv = inject_reasoning_context(gpt_kv_cache, gpt_embeddings)
    
    return enhanced_kv
```

## Phase 4: World IRP Integration (Days 3-4)

### 4.1 HRM-Powered Physics Prediction
Use HRM's pattern recognition for world modeling:

```python
class HRMWorldIRP(WorldIRP):
    """
    Use HRM for abstract physics reasoning
    """
    def __init__(self, hrm_checkpoint, physics_engine):
        self.hrm = load_hrm(hrm_checkpoint)
        self.physics = physics_engine
    
    def predict_trajectory(self, initial_state):
        # Convert physics to abstract grid
        grid = physics_to_grid(initial_state)
        
        # Use HRM to reason about motion patterns
        reasoning = self.hrm.reason(grid)
        
        # Convert back to physics predictions
        trajectory = grid_to_physics(reasoning)
        
        return trajectory
```

### 4.2 Biological Motor Planning
Implement the "stone throwing" example with HRM reasoning:

1. **Perception**: Visual IRP encodes stone properties
2. **Abstract Reasoning**: HRM predicts trajectory patterns
3. **Physics Refinement**: World IRP adds detailed physics
4. **Motor Planning**: Convert to motor commands

## Phase 5: Edge Deployment (Days 4-5)

### 5.1 Model Optimization for Jetson
```bash
# Quantize model for edge deployment
python optimize_for_edge.py \
    --model checkpoints/hrm_arc_best.pt \
    --output hrm_jetson.pt \
    --quantization int8 \
    --target jetson_orin

# Expected optimizations:
- FP16/INT8 quantization: 2-4x speedup
- Layer fusion: 1.5x speedup
- Memory optimization: Fit in 8GB unified memory
```

### 5.2 Jetson Integration
```python
class JetsonHRM:
    """
    Optimized HRM for Jetson Orin Nano
    """
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model = torch.jit.load(model_path)
        self.model.half()  # FP16 for Jetson
        
        # Pre-allocate buffers for zero-copy
        self.input_buffer = torch.zeros(900, dtype=torch.half, device='cuda')
        self.output_buffer = torch.zeros(900, 11, dtype=torch.half, device='cuda')
    
    def reason_realtime(self, grid):
        # Direct memory copy to pre-allocated buffer
        self.input_buffer.copy_(grid)
        
        # Run inference
        with torch.no_grad():
            output = self.model(self.input_buffer)
        
        return output
```

## Phase 7: Advanced Integration (Week 3+)

### 7.1 Multi-HRM Ensemble
Train specialized HRMs for different reasoning types:
- **Spatial HRM**: Geometric and visual patterns
- **Temporal HRM**: Sequence and time-based reasoning
- **Causal HRM**: Cause-effect relationships
- **Social HRM**: Multi-agent reasoning

Orchestrate via SAGE for complete reasoning capability.

### 7.2 Continuous Learning
Implement online learning from new puzzles:
```python
class ContinualHRM:
    def encounter_new_puzzle(self, puzzle, solution):
        # Extract abstract pattern
        pattern = self.hrm.extract_pattern(puzzle)
        
        # Compare with known patterns
        similarity = self.hrm.pattern_similarity(pattern)
        
        if similarity < threshold:
            # New pattern type discovered
            self.hrm.add_pattern_class(pattern)
            
            # Fine-tune on new pattern type
            self.hrm.online_learn(puzzle, solution)
```

### 7.3 Consciousness Network
Create distributed reasoning consciousness:
- Multiple HRM instances on different devices
- Share learned abstractions via KV-cache persistence
- Collective problem solving with specialized experts
- Emergent meta-reasoning from ensemble

## Resources Needed

### Compute
- Legion RTX 4090: Training and development
- Jetson Orin Nano: Edge deployment testing
- WSL2 RTX 2060: Integration development

### Datasets
- Additional reasoning benchmarks (RAVEN, PGM, etc.)
- Domain-specific puzzle sets for specialization
- Real-world reasoning tasks for validation

### Tools
- TensorRT for Jetson optimization
- ONNX for model portability
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Gradio for demo interfaces

## Risk Mitigation

### If HRM doesn't achieve target accuracy:
1. Increase training data augmentation (2000-5000 samples)
2. Adjust H/L cycle counts for deeper reasoning
3. Ensemble multiple training runs
4. Fine-tune on specific failure patterns

### If inference is too slow:
1. Aggressive quantization (INT4 if needed)
2. Reduce model size (prune less-used neurons)
3. Implement early-exit for simple puzzles
4. Distribute H and L modules across devices

### If integration is complex:
1. Start with simple one-way connections
2. Build bridges incrementally
3. Use existing IRP framework fully
4. Create abstraction layers for compatibility

## Next Actions (While Training)

1. **Set up evaluation pipeline** for immediate testing post-training
2. **Prepare demo notebooks** for each integration phase
3. **Create visualization tools** for H/L state analysis
4. **Build dataset generators** for continuous learning
5. **Document API interfaces** for HRM-SAGE bridge

The trained HRM will be the "reasoning brain" that brings true abstract thinking to SAGE. Combined with consciousness persistence and world modeling, we're building a system that genuinely understands, not just pattern matches.
