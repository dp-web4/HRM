# Fine-Tuning Catastrophic Failure Report

## Summary
The fine-tuning attempt with extended reasoning (20 cycles) resulted in catastrophic performance degradation:
- Original model: 49.1% on AGI-1
- After 3000 steps: 8.1% on AGI-1 (-83% relative)
- After 6000 steps: 9.2% on AGI-1 (-81% relative)

## Root Cause Identified
The halt predictor was completely broken during fine-tuning:
- Outputs 0.9999 probability from the FIRST cycle
- Model stops after just 4 cycles instead of using 20
- The enhanced Sequential halt_predictor wasn't initialized properly

## Technical Details

### What Went Wrong
1. **Halt Predictor Issue**:
   - New Sequential architecture replaced simple Linear layer
   - Outputs near 1.0 immediately, triggering early stop
   - Model only uses 4 cycles out of 20 available

2. **Architecture Mismatch**:
   - Fine-tuned model has different halt_predictor structure
   - Loading with strict=False bypassed the issue but didn't fix initialization

3. **Training Loss Stayed High**:
   - Loss remained around 2.0 throughout training
   - No improvement despite 6000+ steps
   - Model essentially became random

### Evidence from Diagnosis
```python
# Halt probabilities after fine-tuning:
[0.9999, 0.9999, 0.9999, 0.9999]  # Stops at cycle 4
Average halt prob: 1.000

# Original model would show:
[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95]  # Gradual increase, stops at cycle 5-8
```

## Why Extended Reasoning Failed

The strategy was sound but the implementation had a critical bug:
1. Enhanced halt_predictor wasn't initialized properly from original weights
2. Random initialization led to extreme outputs
3. Model learned to always halt early to minimize halt loss
4. Never got to use extended reasoning cycles

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify architectural changes work**: The enhanced halt_predictor should have been tested before training
2. **Monitor reasoning cycles during training**: We saw "cycles=4.0" consistently but didn't catch it
3. **Careful with loss balancing**: The halt loss dominated, forcing early stopping

## Next Steps

1. Fix the halt_predictor initialization:
   - Properly transfer weights from original Linear to new Sequential
   - Or use a simpler modification that preserves compatibility
   
2. Better halt policy:
   - Don't allow stopping before minimum cycles (e.g., 5)
   - Use temperature/annealing on halt probability
   - Balance halt loss better with task loss

3. Consider alternative approaches:
   - Fixed 20 cycles without adaptive halting for now
   - Gradually increase max cycles during training
   - Use curriculum learning: start with 8, increase to 20

## The Silver Lining

While this attempt failed, it revealed important insights:
- The model IS using the halting mechanism (just badly)
- Architecture changes do affect behavior
- We can control reasoning depth through the halt predictor

This failure is actually progress - we now understand the mechanism better and can fix it properly.
