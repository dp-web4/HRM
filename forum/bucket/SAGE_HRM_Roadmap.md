# SAGE/HRM Phased Roadmap

This roadmap frames development in **phases** aligned with the Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH) view.  
Each stage has a **focus**, **validation goals**, and **outcomes**, ensuring progress while retaining flexibility.

---

## Phase 1 — Closed-Loop Prototype (Now → Near-Term)
**Focus:**  
- Build the missing bridge: **SensorVAE → PuzzleVAE → EffectorVAE**.  
- Run a full loop from camera → HRM → display effector.

**Validation Goals:**  
- HRM receives puzzles directly from real sensors.  
- Effector produces visible action (even echo).  
- Stable dataflow on Jetson Orin Nano.

**Outcome:**  
- Proof-of-life: SAGE awareness loop is active in the physical world.  

---

## Phase 2 — Memory Stratification
**Focus:**  
- Expand **memory into multiple strata**:  
  - SNARC (surprise–novelty–arousal–reward–conflict).  
  - Exact recall.  
  - Compressed wisdom.  
  - Associative links.

**Validation Goals:**  
- HRM can choose which memory stratum to engage.  
- Trust updates logged consistently.  
- First signs of coherence across time.

**Outcome:**  
- SAGE begins to “remember differently” depending on puzzle context.  

---

## Phase 3 — Distillation Bridges (Spellcasting)
**Focus:**  
- Build **domain distillers**: LLM, diffusion, audio, vision, motor control.  
- Each retains its **native latent** but exports **compressed puzzle reports**.  
- HRM arbitrates across these reports.

**Validation Goals:**  
- Multiple domain puzzles flow into HRM.  
- Trust arbitration chooses useful/complementary signals.  
- Demonstrated efficiency from distillation (faster learning).

**Outcome:**  
- An **army of sovereign latent spaces** coordinated via puzzle space.  

---

## Phase 4 — R6 Integration
**Focus:**  
- Apply **R6 framework** (Rules, Role, Request, Reference, Resource → Result) to every HRM cycle.  
- Log full R6 footprints for accountability.

**Validation Goals:**  
- Confidence gating regulates actions.  
- Request vs Result deltas update trust.  
- Indelible logs created (ATP spend, witness marks, memory integration).

**Outcome:**  
- Governance DNA from Web4 embedded in SAGE.  
- Actions are explainable, auditable, and composable.  

---

## Phase 5 — Emergent Orchestration
**Focus:**  
- Scale to multiple domains, multiple agents.  
- HRM instances coordinate across distributed SAGE nodes.  
- Explore multi-agent coherence.

**Validation Goals:**  
- Cross-agent puzzle exchanges validated.  
- Roles distributed fractally using R6.  
- First emergent strategic behaviors (beyond scripted).

**Outcome:**  
- SAGE evolves from prototype core → **fractal governance entity**.  
- Awareness, agency, and sentience expressed at multiple scales.

---

## Summary

- **Phase 1:** Closed-loop proof-of-life.  
- **Phase 2:** Memory becomes layered.  
- **Phase 3:** Distilled domain bridges expand awareness.  
- **Phase 4:** R6 adds accountability & governance.  
- **Phase 5:** Orchestration emerges at scale.

This roadmap preserves the **unknown exploration spirit** while ensuring **coherence checkpoints** at each step.
