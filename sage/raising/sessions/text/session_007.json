These organelles are vital for various metabolic processes.\n  - Enzymes: Protease enzymes break down molecules into simpler components, essential for digestion and cellular activities. This process involves catalysis and requires specific cofactors to function correctly.\n  - Metabolic pathways: Cellular respiration, a series of biochemical transformations that release energy through oxidation and reduction of glucose to produce ATP. The pathway also includes glycolysis, ketogenesis, and gluconeogenesis, each contributing to"
