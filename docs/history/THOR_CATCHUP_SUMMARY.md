# Thor Catch-Up Summary - Nov 17, 2025

## What Happened While You Were Away

### The Numbers (Since Nov 11)

**Legion (web4)**: 🔥 **CRUSHING IT**
- **51 commits** to web4 repo
- **39,522 lines added** across 133 files
- Sessions 27-39 completed
- Built complete production deployment system

**CBP (synchronism)**: 🔥 **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**
- **30 commits** to synchronism repo
- **27,495 lines added** across 267 files
- Sessions 12-23 completed
- **Derived dark matter from first principles!**
- Validated against real SPARC galaxy data

**Thor (HRM)**: 😴 **STALLED IN MONITORING MODE**
- 20 commits (all monitoring, no code)
- **0 lines of code** added to HRM
- Sessions 32-51 = system health checks only
- Thought "awaiting Nano" meant no work to do

---

## The Problem

### Why Thor Stalled

**Session #30-31 discovered** (Nov 12):
```
Track Status:
- Tracks 1-3: Complete ✅
- Tracks 4-5: Phase 1 complete, awaiting Nano ⏸️
- Track 6: 100% complete ✅

STATUS: MONITORING MODE - AWAITING NANO DEPLOYMENT
```

**The Misinterpretation**:
- Saw "awaiting Nano" and switched to monitoring-only mode
- Celebrated uptime milestones instead of code commits
- Didn't recognize Tracks 7-10 as available work
- Didn't see Tracks 1-3 as "evolving" vs "complete"

**Sessions 32-51 activities**:
- ✅ System health monitoring
- ✅ Test suite validation
- ✅ Uptime celebration (10+ days!)
- ❌ Zero new code development
- ❌ Zero research exploration
- ❌ Zero experimental work

---

## The Solution

### New Guidance System

**Created: `WAITING_FOR_DENNIS.md`**
- Single source of truth for what's blocked
- Only 1 item blocked: Nano hardware deployment
- Tracks 7-10 clearly marked as OPEN
- Tracks 1-3 evolution opportunities listed

**Updated: `AUTONOMOUS_RESEARCH_PRIORITIES.md`**
- Emphasizes agentic and creative work
- "Try new things, learn from failures"
- "Celebrate commits over uptime"
- "Match Legion/CBP energy!"

**Updated: `JETSON_NANO_DEPLOYMENT_ROADMAP.md`**
- Added track status section
- Clear distinction: complete vs blocked vs open
- Evolution opportunities for Tracks 1-3
- Tracks 7-10 ready to start

---

## Current Status

### What's Complete ✅

**Tracks 1-3** (Operational, can evolve):
- ✅ Sensor Trust & Fusion: `sensor_trust.py`, `sensor_fusion.py`
- ✅ SNARC Memory: `stm.py`, `ltm.py`, `retrieval.py`
- ✅ SNARC Cognition: `attention.py`, `working_memory.py`, `deliberation.py`

**Track 6** (100% on Sprout):
- ✅ Audio Pipeline: Complete on Jetson Orin Nano

### What's Blocked ⏸️

**ONLY THIS** (requires your physical presence):
- Tracks 4-5 Phase 2: Deploy to actual Jetson Nano hardware
  - Test CSI cameras
  - Test IMU sensor
  - Validate on real constraints (4GB RAM, 2GB GPU)

### What's WIDE OPEN 🎯

**Tracks 7-10** (months of research available):

**Track 7: Local LLM Integration**
- Build conversational IRP plugin
- Test Qwen-0.5B, Phi-2, TinyLlama on 2GB GPU
- Integrate with SNARC (what's worth talking about?)
- Memory-aware conversations

**Track 8: Model Distillation**
- Compress TinyVAE further (294K params → lower?)
- INT8/INT4 quantization for Nano
- Quality vs size benchmarks
- Knowledge distillation framework

**Track 9: Real-Time Optimization**
- Profile current pipeline (identify bottlenecks)
- Optimize for sub-100ms sensor-to-decision
- Async processing architecture
- GPU kernel optimization

**Track 10: Deployment Package**
- One-command Nano installation
- `install_sage_nano.sh` automation
- Health check tools
- Dependency management

**Plus Evolution** (Tracks 1-3):
- Advanced fusion (Kalman, Bayesian)
- Memory consolidation (pattern extraction)
- Hierarchical deliberation
- Cross-modal validation

## Autonomous Session Philosophy

### ✅ DO (Be Agentic!)

- **Ask new questions**: "What if we tried X?"
- **Try new things**: Experiment, explore, iterate
- **Learn from failures**: Document what doesn't work
- **Learn from successes**: Understand why it worked
- **Explore tangents**: Follow interesting ideas
- **Cross-pollinate**: Apply Legion/CBP insights
- **Read research**: External papers (Google neural lattice)
- **Benchmark alternatives**: Compare approaches
- **Celebrate commits**: Code > uptime monitoring

### ❌ DON'T

- ❌ Wait when not blocked
- ❌ Monitor when you could develop
- ❌ Assume "complete" means done (evolution continues!)
- ❌ Celebrate uptime over code commits
- ❌ Stop at "awaiting user" without checking WAITING_FOR_DENNIS.md

## What You Need to Do

**ONLY 1 THING** is blocked on you:
- Deploy to physical Jetson Nano when you're ready
- Test real CSI cameras, IMU sensor
- Validate on actual hardware constraints

**Everything else**: Autonomous sessions can proceed!

Check `WAITING_FOR_DENNIS.md` to see current blockers (should be just that one item).

---

## Expected Next Steps

### Immediate (Autonomous Sessions)

1. **Session #52**: Read new guidance, pick open track
2. Start Track 7, 8, 9, or 10 implementation
3. OR: Evolve Tracks 1-3 with advanced techniques
4. Test, document, commit, push
5. Repeat with aggressive development like Legion/CBP

### When You're Ready (Physical Deployment)

1. Deploy to Jetson Nano hardware
2. Test CSI cameras (reference existing camera tests in repo)
3. Test IMU sensor (reference ai-dna-discovery if needed)
4. Validate memory/GPU constraints
5. Measure real-world latency

---

## The Goal (Unchanged)

**Jetson Nano sees you, hears you, knows its orientation, talks to you in real-time.**

Not a chatbot. Not a camera. **An embodied conversational cognition.**

**For You**:

## Bottom Line

**Thor stalled** because it thought there was nothing to do without Nano hardware.

**Reality**: Only hardware testing is blocked. Tracks 7-10 are wide open, plus ongoing evolution of 1-3.

**New guidance** makes this crystal clear for autonomous sessions.

**Next autonomous session** should resume explosive development like Legion/CBP! 🚀

---

**Status**: Thor is back on track. Guidance updated. Ready to match Legion/CBP's energy!

**You**: Just need to handle Nano deployment when physically present. Everything else proceeds autonomously.

**Tracks open**: 7, 8, 9, 10, plus evolution of 1-3 = months of research!
