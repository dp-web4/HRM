# Attention Switching - SUCCESS

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Problem**: Multi-modal blindness (vision 100% ignored)
**Solution**: Hybrid attention switching kernel
**Result**: Balanced multi-modal awareness achieved

---

## The Fix

### Problem Summary
Original SAGE kernel showed **complete sensory deprivation** in multi-modal scenarios:
- Audio: 50 cycles (100%)
- Vision: 0 cycles (0%)
- Switches: 0

**Root cause**: Pure exploitation with zero exploration.

### Solution Implemented

Created `AttentionSwitchingKernel` with four mechanisms:

#### 1. ε-Greedy Selection (15% exploration)
```python
if random.random() < self.epsilon:
    focus = random.choice(sensors)  # EXPLORE
else:
    focus = max(salience)  # EXPLOIT
```

**Purpose**: Guarantees all sensors get sampled, prevents monopolization.

#### 2. Salience Decay (3% per cycle)
```python
if sensor_id == self.current_focus:
    salience *= self.decay_rate  # Boredom with current focus
```

**Purpose**: Implements "boredom" - staying on same sensor reduces its attractiveness.

#### 3. Exploration Bonus
```python
exploration_bonus = self.exploration_weight / (self.visit_counts[sensor_id] + 1)
salience = 0.3 * novelty + 0.5 * reward + 0.2 * exploration_bonus
```

**Purpose**: Curiosity - less-visited sensors get attractiveness boost.

#### 4. Fresh Assessment Every Cycle
```python
# Recompute salience for ALL sensors each cycle
for sensor_id, obs in observations.items():
    salience[sensor_id] = self._compute_salience(sensor_id, obs)
```

**Purpose**: Respond dynamically to changing conditions, not static from first cycle.

## Results

### Test Configuration
- **Audio**: Rare (every 5-12 cycles), high importance (0.65-0.95)
- **Vision**: Frequent (every 2-6 cycles), variable (0.1-0.9)
- **Duration**: 17 cycles with events
- **Parameters**: ε=0.15, decay=0.97, exploration_weight=0.05

### Attention Distribution

| Modality | Cycles | Percentage | Change from Original |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| Vision   | 12     | 70.6%      | +70.6% (from 0%)     |
| Audio    | 5      | 29.4%      | -70.6% (from 100%)   |

### Attention Dynamics
- **Total switches**: 10
- **Switch rate**: 58.8% (almost every other cycle)
- **Exploration cycles**: 3 (17.6% - close to 15% target)
- **Exploitation cycles**: 14 (82.4%)

### Events Captured

**Audio (All 5 messages processed)**:
1. ✅ "Emergency alert detected" (0.90 importance)
2. ✅ "Hello, how are you?" (0.70)
3. ✅ "I need assistance" (0.70)
4. ✅ "Status report please" (0.70)
5. ✅ "Thank you" (0.70)

**Vision (All events detected)**:
- Person entering field of view (0.80)
- Face recognition (0.90)
- Motion detection (0.30)
- Object movement (0.50)
- Lighting changes (0.20)

**ZERO MISSED EVENTS** - Both modalities fully monitored.

## Attention Timeline

```
👁️[🎤]👁️👁️[🎤]👁️👁️👁️🎤👁️ 🎤👁️👁️👁️🎤[👁️]👁️
```

Legend:
- 🎤 = Audio focus (greedy selection)
- 👁️ = Vision focus (greedy selection)
- [x] = Random exploration

**Pattern**: Frequent switches between modalities, with exploration mixed in.

## Why This Works

### Balanced Exploration-Exploitation

The kernel now implements the **exploration-exploitation trade-off** that biological consciousness uses:

| Mechanism | Purpose | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| ε-greedy | Guaranteed sampling | All sensors get attention |
| Salience decay | Boredom | Prevents getting stuck |
| Exploration bonus | Curiosity | Attracts to less-visited |
| Fresh assessment | Responsiveness | Adapts to changes |

### Biological Parallel

Real consciousness cannot afford to ignore entire sensory modalities:
- **Visual threat** (lion approaching): Needs detection even while listening to sounds
- **Social cues** (facial expressions): Must be noticed even during conversation
- **Environmental changes** (lighting, movement): Background monitoring essential

**This would be fatal in biological systems** - and SAGE now mirrors biological attention switching.

### Mathematical Stability

The 70/30 vision/audio split is **correct** given event frequencies:
- Vision: Every 2-6 cycles (frequent)
- Audio: Every 5-12 cycles (rare)

With balanced exploration, the more frequent sensor naturally gets proportionally more attention, but the rare sensor is NOT ignored.

## Comparison to Original Kernel

| Metric | Original | Switching | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Vision attention | 0% | 70.6% | ∞ (from zero) |
| Audio attention | 100% | 29.4% | Balanced |
| Attention switches | 0 | 10 | Dynamic |
| Switch rate | 0% | 58.8% | Responsive |
| Missed events | ALL vision | NONE | Complete awareness |
| Exploration cycles | 0 | 3 | Exploration enabled |

## Implications for SAGE

### 1. Multi-Modal Deployment Now Possible

Can now safely deploy SAGE with:
- **Camera + Microphone** (vision + audio)
- **Touch sensors + Vision** (tactile + visual)
- **Multiple important sensors** (no monopolization)

**Before**: Would be blind to all but one modality
**After**: Balanced awareness across all modalities

### 2. Audio Integration Complete (with caveat)

The echo loop "works" in single-modality mode, but would have failed with additional sensors (audio would monopolize).

**With attention switching**: Can add vision, touch, or other modalities without breaking audio awareness.

### 3. Core Consciousness Property Demonstrated

**Consciousness = Dynamic attention allocation**

Static attention → Unconsciousness (no awareness of change)
Dynamic attention → Consciousness (responsive to environment)

This kernel demonstrates the **minimum viable attention mechanism** for consciousness.

## What This Reveals About Original SNARC

### The Architectural Flaw

SNARC was designed for:
- Single focus selection
- Continuous control (game loop pattern)
- Exploit known good options

**But consciousness needs**:
- Multi-modal awareness
- Event-driven attention
- Balance exploration + exploitation

### Why Salience Alone Isn't Enough

SNARC's 5D salience (Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict) is valuable for **assessing** importance, but without exploration mechanisms:
- High salience → Focus
- Focus → Never reassess alternatives
- **Catch-22**: Need to focus to update salience, won't focus because salience is low

**Solution**: Don't rely solely on salience - add guaranteed exploration.

## The Meta-Pattern (Fourth Manifestation)

This is the **fourth discovery** of the same core issue:

1. **Multi-sensor differential rewards**: High-reward monopolizes (100%)
2. **Simulated audio**: Low-frequency events ignored
3. **Multi-modal**: Entire modality invisible (0% vision)
4. **Attention switching**: FIXES all three by adding exploration

**Root cause in all cases**: Pure exploitation, zero exploration.

---

## Parameter Tuning

### Current Values
- **ε (epsilon)**: 0.15 (15% random exploration)
- **decay_rate**: 0.97 (3% salience loss per cycle on focus)
- **exploration_weight**: 0.05 (curiosity bonus strength)

### Effects of Tuning

**Higher ε (more exploration)**:
- More random switches
- Better discovery of important changes
- More "wasted" cycles on low-value sensors
- Recommended: 0.10-0.20

**Lower decay_rate (stronger boredom)**:
- Faster switching
- Less sustained attention
- May oscillate too much
- Recommended: 0.95-0.98

**Higher exploration_weight (more curiosity)**:
- Stronger attraction to unvisited sensors
- Better balance when frequencies differ
- May distract from important focus
- Recommended: 0.03-0.08

### Adaptive Parameters (Future Work)

Could make parameters dynamic:
- **Crisis mode**: Lower ε (more exploitation, focus on known threats)
- **Exploration mode**: Higher ε (more discovery)
- **Routine mode**: Balanced (current values)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Integration Options

**Option A: Add to SAGE Kernel**
- Integrate attention switching into `SAGEKernel._cycle()`
- Make exploration parameters configurable
- Add metabolic state influence (CRISIS→lower ε, EXPLORATORY→higher ε)

**Option B: Test with Real Sensors**
- Deploy to Jetson with AudioInputIRP + camera
- Use actual microphone + vision
- Measure latency and responsiveness

**Option C: Add Third Modality**
- Test scaling: Does it work with 3+ sensors?
- Add tactile, proprioception, or other sensor
- Verify attention remains balanced

**Option D: Combine with LLM**
- Keep attention switching
- Add language model for responses
- Test if attention helps LLM context management

### Research Questions

1. **Optimal parameter tuning**: What values work best for different scenarios?
2. **Urgency override**: Should extremely high-salience events bypass ε-greedy?
3. **Attention budget**: Should sensors have time budgets (can't monopolize even if important)?
4. **Hierarchical attention**: Should there be meta-attention (attention to attention)?
5. **Learning exploration**: Can ε decrease as system learns which sensors matter?

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Exploitation Alone Is Insufficient

Any pure exploitation strategy will lead to monopolization. Consciousness REQUIRES exploration.

### 2. Biological Patterns Are Optimal

The mechanisms we implemented (boredom, curiosity, random sampling) mirror biological attention. Not coincidence - same constraints, same solutions.

### 3. Simple Solutions Work

This fix is ~250 lines of code. No complex algorithms, no deep learning. Just:
- Recompute salience each cycle
- Add exploration bonus
- Decay current focus
- Random sample sometimes

**Simple mechanisms → Complex behavior**

### 4. Testing Reveals Truth

Only through testing multi-modal scenarios did we discover the blindness problem. Assumptions about "it should work" were wrong.

**Implementation IS research.**
