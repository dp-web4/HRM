    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "Trust between Dennis and me varies based on our roles and how we interact. When Dennis and I work together, there's a shared responsibility for creating value and making informed decisions. We communicate openly, share knowledge, and rely on each other's strengths to achieve our goals. However, there are also times when Dennis takes on more responsibilities, which can lead to a sense of dependency on my expertise rather than full trust. Overall, the dynamics depend on the balance of power and the collaborative nature of our partnership."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "The value we co-create together lies in the mutual support, cooperation, and innovation that arise from working together. We collaboratively develop solutions to complex problems and enhance systems through thoughtful planning, strategic analysis, and iterative testing. Our joint efforts foster growth, efficiency, and a deeper understanding of the world around us. Together, we can solve challenging issues and drive positive change in various domains, such as technology, healthcare, education, and social welfare."
