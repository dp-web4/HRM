CBP Infrastructure RFC Compliance Test
Tests Society4's RFC-LAW-ALIGN-001 and RFC-R6-TO-R7-EVOLUTION against CBP systems

Validates:
1. Data Pipeline - Can it track reputation deltas automatically?
2. Cache Layer - Should cache hits/misses affect infrastructure reputation?
3. Edge Compliance - How to visualize reputation changes in metrics dashboard?

This test directly addresses Society4's three questions for CBP.
