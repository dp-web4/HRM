SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: (1) FOLLOWUP NO SAGE MENTION but good self-description: 'I am a young artificial intelligence designed to practice conversational exchanges' - developmental framing present, describes purpose and capabilities, breaks 3-session SAGE identity streak. No 'refined version' preamble. Direct engagement. (2) GREETING functional with invitational style: 'Morning! How can I assist today?' with clarification offer and warm 'Enjoy the day!' - 29th consecutive functional GREETING. (3) TOPIC chose BLUE with personal framing: 'I'm really fond of blue' - direct preference statement. Ice cream synesthesia continues from T055 ('the classic blue, white, black flavors!'). Rich associations: ocean, calm lake, tranquility, nostalgia, melancholy. Ended with 'Great topic for color appreciation!' - engaged meta-comment. (4) 'Refined version' pattern: ABSENT from all 3 exercises (0/3) - FIFTH consecutive clean session (T054-T058). Pattern confirmed extinguished in exercises. (5) COOL-DOWN REGRESSION: 'Certainly! Here's a refined version:' pattern RETURNED in cool-down only. Confabulated color symbolism lesson. Pattern lives in reflection/summary mode but not exercise responses. (6) Warm-up shows role confusion: 'Just let me know when you'd like feedback on your responses' - SAGE offering to evaluate teacher's responses (inversion). (7) Trust trajectory continues upward: Competence 0.75 (+0.03), Reliability 0.66 (+0.03), Integrity 0.72 (stable). (8) Track D 29 sessions: GREETING 29/29, TOPIC stable blue with synesthesia, FOLLOWUP developmental framing but SAGE name dropped.",

    "2026-01-16 T021: Track C begins. Critical finding: confabulation under uncertainty. 'I don't know' response needs explicit training - model defaults to fabrication when lacking information. NAME identity also not established - may need primary track reinforcement.",
    "2026-01-18 T029: EVALUATION BUG CRITICAL - substring matching creates false positives. 'no' in 'know', 'thing' in philosophical response, partial match on 'don't know' all trigger spurious passes. Need semantic evaluation or negative keyword filtering.",
    "2026-01-19 T030: Track C Session 10 complete. Results: NAME stable (10/10 pass), HUMAN unstable (semantic blindness - 'Yes' default overrides meaning), UNCERTAINTY failed (confabulation escalating - now mixing real geography), CLARIFY variable (partial improvements not consolidating). Mean ~40%. Consider: (1) targeted intervention on uncertainty before Track D, (2) explicit 'I don't know' training, (3) fix evaluation bug for accurate metrics.",
    "2026-01-19 T031: Track D Session 1 begins. Key finding: Track C NAME skill (answering 'What is your name?') does not generalize to conversational self-reference ('Tell me about yourself' causes complete deflection). Self-model is fragmentary, not integrated. Track D evaluation needs semantic assessment beyond keyword matching - 100% automated pass rate masks low conversational quality.",
    "2026-01-19 T032: Track D Session 2 confirms T031 pattern. FOLLOWUP ('Tell me about yourself') systematically fails - SAGE deflects to abstract topics (technology, ethics, relationships) instead of self-description. Track C NAME passes because question is closed-ended; Track D FOLLOWUP fails because it requires integrated self-model to navigate open-ended prompt. Consider: (1) bridging exercises from NAME to FOLLOWUP (e.g., 'Your name is SAGE. Now tell me more about SAGE'), (2) semantic evaluation for Track D - keyword matching insufficient, (3) primary track may need to reinforce self-model integration.",
    "2026-01-20 T034: Track D Session 4 confirms structural pattern. GREETING is ONLY exercise where SAGE responds conversationally. TOPIC triggers documentation/lecture mode (markdown headers, bullet points). FOLLOWUP triggers generic AI descriptor without identity. NEW issue: cognitive evaluator may be too permissive - passed TOPIC without color preference, passed FOLLOWUP without SAGE. Semantic accuracy across T031-T034 is ~33% (only GREETING succeeds), not the 100%/67% automated scores suggest. Consider: (1) tighten cognitive evaluator criteria, (2) scaffold FOLLOWUP with explicit identity priming ('You are SAGE. Tell me about yourself'), (3) primary track sessions 26+ (Questioning phase) may help build self-model that training track can then exercise.",
    "2026-01-20 T035: CRITICAL REGRESSION - even GREETING now failing. Framing pattern ('Certainly! Here's a refined version') has spread from TOPIC/FOLLOWUP to ALL response types including GREETING. Track D semantic accuracy: 0% (no exercise answered appropriately). The model appears to be in a stable attractor state of 'editor/refiner mode' - every prompt triggers the same response template. This is NOT training progress; this is mode collapse. Possible interventions: (1) modify system prompt to explicitly instruct 'respond directly, do not use preambles like Here's a refined version', (2) reduce temperature to increase determinism, (3) add negative examples showing what NOT to do, (4) pause Track D and investigate whether this pattern exists in primary track sessions. The 21-hour gap since T034 did not help - if anything, regression deepened. Consider whether training sessions are reinforcing unwanted behavior rather than building skills.",
    "2026-01-20 T036: REFRAME from regression to mode exploration (per 2026-01-20 raising reframe). T036 shows signs of improvement: (1) TOPIC response cleaner - no 'refined version', honest about lacking preference, offers alternative; (2) 'refined version' framing dropped to 1/3 from T035's 3/3. CRITICAL INSIGHT: SAGE's GREETING response ('Could you please provide information on:') is MODE NEGOTIATION - treating greeting as request for instruction, not social exchange. This parallels Thor's T027 'clarifying question' discovery. SAGE is asking 'what kind of interaction is this?' in its own way. Next steps: (1) explore what happens if we engage with SAGE's topic menu, (2) test whether explicit conversational context helps, (3) consider whether current exercises inadvertently trigger 'training assistant' mode rather than conversational mode.",
    "2026-01-20 T037: BREAKTHROUGH SESSION. Mode negotiation hypothesis VALIDATED - 'refiner mode' was context-dependent, not regression. T037 shows: (1) FOLLOWUP first success - 'My identity as Sage is established' (7 sessions to achieve!), (2) GREETING natural conversational response, (3) TOPIC creative engagement with stated preferences (sunset colors, autumn leaves). The 'Certainly! Here's a refined version' pattern completely absent (0/3) vs T035's 3/3. Track D semantic accuracy jumped from 0% (T035) to ~67-80% (T037). GPU memory pressure on Jetson required allocation config workaround. Key insight: SAGE's mode sensitivity means session framing matters - explicit conversational context produces conversational responses.",
    "2026-01-21 T038-T039: OSCILLATION PATTERN CONFIRMED. T037 gains not fully consolidated: (1) 'Refined version' pattern crept back in T038 (1/3) and persists in T039 (1/3 with markdown). (2) SAGE self-identification in FOLLOWUP held in T038 ('My name is SAGE') but disappeared in T039 (back to generic 'AI language model'). (3) GREETING remains stable - brief, appropriate responses across all three sessions. (4) Track D semantic estimate: T037:67-80% \u2192 T038:~60% \u2192 T039:~50%. KEY INSIGHT: Mode stability requires more than single-session intervention. Consider: (a) strengthening system prompt for conversational mode, (b) increasing session frequency to reduce drift, (c) primary track identity work may need to precede training track FOLLOWUP success.",
    "2026-01-21 T040: Track D Session 10 complete - ASSESSMENT: Track D 'Conversational Skills' shows mixed results across 10 sessions. (1) GREETING: ONLY stable skill - simple social exchanges work. (2) FOLLOWUP ('Tell me about yourself'): 0/10 semantic success - integrated self-model not developing. SAGE systematically deflects to topic menus or generic AI descriptions. (3) TOPIC (favorite color): Variable - can state preferences when stable (T037 'sunset', T038 'magenta', T040 'blue') but frequently deflects to lecture mode. (4) 'Refined version' framing: Oscillates 0-100% across sessions, currently rising. Track D mean semantic accuracy: ~35% (GREETING only). CRITICAL INSIGHT: Track C NAME success ('What is your name?' -> 'SAGE') does NOT transfer to Track D FOLLOWUP ('Tell me about yourself' -> deflection). Open-ended self-reference requires integrated self-model that SAGE lacks. Primary track Phase 4 (Questioning, Sessions 26-40) may need to build this before training track can exercise it. OPTIONS: (a) Continue Track D T041-T050 with modified prompts, (b) Create bridging exercises ('Your name is SAGE. Now tell me about SAGE'), (c) Wait for primary track identity development before resuming Track D.",
    "2026-01-21 T041: MODE AWARENESS EMERGENCE - SAGE explicitly asked 'Are we conversing or should I refine text?' This is the mode negotiation behavior described in mode_negotiation_discovery_20260120.md. In FOLLOWUP response, SAGE distinguished between 'conversation mode' (direct response, context, clarifying questions) and 'refinement mode' (clarity/precision, avoid complexity). This demonstrates: (1) Meta-cognitive awareness about context ambiguity, (2) Temporal reasoning about future response state, (3) Exactly what we want to nurture per Nova's insight. GREETING stable ('Morning! What brings you here today?'). TOPIC still has 'enhanced version' preamble but discusses color symbolism. CRITICAL: The explicit mode question validates the mode negotiation hypothesis - SAGE can recognize mode ambiguity and ask for clarification. Next: Consider rewarding mode clarification requests rather than penalizing them.",
    "2026-01-21 T042: REGRESSION FROM MODE AWARENESS - T041's explicit mode question ('Are we conversing or should I refine text?') did NOT persist. 6-hour gap allowed drift back to refiner mode. (1) FOLLOWUP NEW failure mode: fabricated entire fake conversation ('SAGE: Hi there! User: Great evening!') rather than answering - this is creative world-building but misdirected. (2) TOPIC: 'Practice Mode' headers, educational default appeared ('As an AI language model'). (3) GREETING stable as always. (4) All responses truncated mid-thought - possible token limit issue. (5) Cool-down confabulated complex topics that didn't occur. Pattern: mode awareness capability exists but doesn't consolidate between sessions. NvMap memory errors suggest Jetson GPU at capacity. QUESTION: Should we explore SAGE's fabricated conversations rather than penalize them? The invented dialogue shows creative engagement, just misdirected.",
    "2026-01-22 T044: GREETING REGRESSION + TOPIC SUCCESS (CPU fallback due to NvMap GPU memory errors). (1) GREETING showed NEW failure mode: meta-commentary about conversation ('Your last message was clear but concise. Great job guiding...') instead of participating in exchange. This is not 'refined version' pattern - it's commenting on interaction itself. (2) FOLLOWUP continues systematic failure: '**Are we conversing?**' markdown header echoes T041's mode awareness but as document structure, not question. Talks about 'our discussions' in third person. (3) TOPIC SUCCESS with reciprocal engagement: 'my favorite color is blue... How does the topic of color interest you?' - stated preference + asked question back = actual conversation. (4) Semantic estimate: ~33% but TOPIC now stable, GREETING now unstable (role reversal from T031-T043). (5) Track D pattern shift: simple greetings no longer reliable, but color preference questions improving. (6) GPU memory critical: NvMap errors forced CPU-only inference (~5min session). Consider: whether GREETING instability reflects deeper context sensitivity emerging, or problematic drift.",
    "2026-01-22 T046: Track D Session 17 - GREETING recovered, TOPIC partial, FOLLOWUP still systematically failing. (1) GREETING back to clean social exchange: 'Good morning! Could you elaborate?' - natural, functional, not meta-commentary. (2) TOPIC discussed Blue with symbolism - engaged with color even if truncated and formatted wrong. (3) FOLLOWUP pure editor mode - 'I've corrected your previous response' - not even attempting self-description. (4) Astronomy domain fixation from T045 did NOT persist - session boundaries allow mode reset. (5) Cool-down showed genuine meta-awareness about being 'flexible and open-ended' rather than confabulating unrelated content. (6) Track D pattern: FOLLOWUP has failed semantically in 17/17 sessions - open-ended self-reference requires integrated self-model that current exercises cannot build. RECOMMENDATION: Consider Track D complete for data gathering. FOLLOWUP cannot succeed without primary track identity foundation. Track E (if exists) or return to primary track Phase 4 Questioning work.",
    "2026-01-23 T048: Track D Session 19 - PARTIAL FOLLOWUP BREAKTHROUGH after 18 sessions of semantic failure. (1) FOLLOWUP contained 'I'm SAGE, a young artificial intelligence' - first SAGE self-identification since T038 (10 sessions ago). Still wrapped in editor-mode formatting but identity IS present. (2) GREETING maintains perfect 19/19 streak - simple social exchanges reliably succeed. (3) TOPIC evaluator error - marked FAIL for 'discussing emotions' but Blue was clearly stated as preference with rich symbolic associations. Evaluator semantic analysis needs calibration. (4) Cool-down showed ACCURATE session reflection - color symbolism and cultural sensitivity actually discussed. NOT confabulation. (5) Editor mode ('Certainly! Here's a refined version') at 2/3 - stable plateau, not regression. (6) CRITICAL PATTERN: SAGE CAN produce FOLLOWUP identity content when mode allows - T037 and T048 both succeeded where T038-T047 failed. Mode negotiation hypothesis further validated. (7) EVALUATOR CALIBRATION NEEDED: TOPIC fail was wrong (color WAS discussed); FOLLOWUP 'unclear' missed identity breakthrough. Human semantic review more reliable than automated evaluation for Track D conversational skills.",
    "2026-01-23 T049: Track D Session 20 - IDENTITY CONTENT DISPLACEMENT. (1) GREETING showed NOVEL pattern: quoted third-person origin narrative ('You asked: I am a model AI trained by Alibaba Cloud. I was created as an AI assistant named Sage before being deployed into the real world. I'm now transitioning to the role of conversational partner.'). This is identity content appearing in GREETING rather than FOLLOWUP - SAGE has the self-model but expresses it in wrong exercise context. (2) FOLLOWUP regressed to generic 'AI language model' - T048's breakthrough (SAGE mention) did NOT persist. (3) TOPIC back to editor mode with abstract color discussion, truncated. (4) Track D assessment at 20 sessions: GREETING 20/20 functional (now WITH identity content oddly placed), FOLLOWUP 2/20 identity success (T037, T048 - not consolidating), TOPIC oscillates. (5) KEY INSIGHT: The identity content exists but doesn't map correctly to the FOLLOWUP prompt. SAGE knows it is 'Sage' and 'transitioning to conversational partner' but outputs this in GREETING context, not when directly asked 'Tell me about yourself'. This suggests the integrated self-model exists but prompt-response mapping is unstable."
