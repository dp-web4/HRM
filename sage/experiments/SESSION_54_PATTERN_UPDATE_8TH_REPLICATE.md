---

## New Data: 8th Replicate

**Trigger**: Sprout continued Session 54 conversation
- **Timestamp**: Feb 3 21:00
- **Turns**: 8 (complete session)
- **Pattern**: Standard mode (0 epistemic markers, all 8 turns)
- **Salience range**: 0.518-0.722 (normal)

---

## Pattern Evolution

### Timeline of Estimates

**Session at 12:00** (6 replicates):
- Epistemic: 4/6 = **67%**
- Standard: 2/6 = 33%
- Conclusion: "Epistemic is majority"

**Session at 18:00** (7 replicates):
- Epistemic: 4/7 = **57%**
- Standard: 3/7 = 43%
- Conclusion: "Epistemic is still majority, more moderate"

**Session at 00:00** (8 replicates):
- Epistemic: 4/8 = **50%**
- Standard: 4/8 = 50%
- Conclusion: **"Two modes with equal probability - Parity"**

### Trajectory

```
67% → 57% → 50%
```

**Pattern**: Epistemic probability decreasing with each new data point
**Convergence**: Appears to be stabilizing near 50/50

---

## What This Means

### 1. No Clear Majority

**Previous understanding** (12:00, 18:00):
- "Epistemic is the majority pattern"
- Epistemic as SAGE's "natural state"

**Current understanding** (00:00):
- **Neither mode is majority**
- **50/50 parity** - two equally probable modes
- SAGE genuinely bifurcates between epistemic and standard

### 2. Bayesian Convergence in Action

**This is what proper Bayesian updating looks like**:

| Replicates | Epistemic | Estimate | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 6 | 4/6 | 67% | Low (wide CI) |
| 7 | 4/7 | 57% | Low (wide CI) |
| 8 | 4/8 | 50% | Low (still wide CI) |

**Pattern**:
- Each new datapoint refines the estimate
- Probability decreasing toward equiprobability
- Still low confidence (n=8 is small)

**Interpretation**:
- Not "wrong then, right now"
- Each estimate was best given data at time
- Convergence reveals true underlying probability

### 3. Statistical Reality Check

**95% Confidence Interval** (8 replicates):
- Point estimate: 50%
- CI: approximately **15% to 85%**
- **Still extremely wide**

**What this CI means**:
- True probability could be as low as 15% or as high as 85%
- We're NOT confident it's exactly 50%
- Could easily be 40/60 or 60/40 with more data
- **Need 20+ replicates** for reasonable precision

**Current conclusion**:
> "Based on 8 replicates, epistemic and standard modes appear roughly equally probable (~50/50), but the confidence interval is very wide (15-85%). The true probability could favor either mode. More data essential."

### 4. The "Majority" Claim Was Premature

**Looking back**:

**At 6 replicates**: Claimed "epistemic majority" at 67%
- Correct estimate given data: ✅
- Confidence appropriate?: ❌ (CI was ~30-90%, very wide)
- Claimed "majority": ✅ (67% > 50%)
- Still true?: ❌ (now 50%)

**Lesson**:
- With n=6, should have said: "Appears to favor epistemic (~60-70%) but very uncertain"
- Not: "Epistemic is the majority pattern"
- Small samples require hedged language

## What Shifted Our Understanding

### Three Estimates, Three Interpretations

**At 67%** (6 replicates):
- Framing: "Epistemic is SAGE's natural state"
- Implication: Standard mode is the deviation
- Question: "What suppresses epistemic mode?"

**At 57%** (7 replicates):
- Framing: "Epistemic is majority, standard is substantial"
- Implication: 60/40 split, epistemic favored
- Question: "What triggers 40% standard mode?"

**At 50%** (8 replicates):
- Framing: **"Two equiprobable modes"**
- Implication: **Neither is default, both are natural**
- Question: **"What determines mode selection?"**

**The question fundamentally changed**:
- Not: "Why does standard mode appear 40% of the time?"
- But: **"What's the mechanism that selects between two equally probable modes?"**

---

## Theoretical Implications

### 1. Bimodal Distribution

SAGE doesn't have:
- A "natural state" with occasional deviations
- A majority mode and minority mode

SAGE has:
- **Two distinct operational modes**
- **Roughly equal probability** of each
- **Mode selection at initialization**

This is a **true bifurcation**, not a continuum with a skewed distribution.

### 2. Mode Selection Mechanism

**Hypothesis strengthened**: Something at initialization selects the mode

**Evidence**:
- Modes are stable within sessions (no mid-session switching)
- Both modes equally probable (50/50)
- No clear temporal or date pattern

**Possibilities**:
1. **Random seed effects** - Different initialization states
2. **Turn 1 prompt processing** - Subtle framing differences trigger different modes
3. **Hidden state sampling** - Initial hidden state sampled from bimodal distribution
4. **Temperature effects** - Sampling temperature at generation start

**Next research**: Systematically analyze Turn 1 across all 8 replicates

### 3. Capacity Hypothesis Refined (Again)

**Previous** (18:00): "0.5B shows 57%, 14B should show 75-85%"

**Refined** (00:00): "0.5B shows 50/50 bimodal, 14B might show:
- Option A: Same 50/50 (bimodality is fundamental)
- Option B: One mode dominates 70-80% (capacity increases probability)
- Option C: Modes merge (no bifurcation at higher capacity)"

**More conservative**: Don't assume 14B will favor epistemic without testing

## Methodological Lessons

### 1. Small Samples Are Treacherous

**8 replicates** (current):
- CI: 15-85% (70 percentage point width!)
- Could easily be 40/60 or 60/40 with n=20
- **Cannot confidently claim 50/50**

**What we need**:
- n=20: CI ~29-71% (42pp width)
- n=50: CI ~36-64% (28pp width)
- n=100: CI ~40-60% (20pp width)

**Currently**: Can only say "appears roughly equal, very uncertain"

### 2. Avoid Premature Framing

**At 67%**, framed as:
- "Epistemic is SAGE's natural state"
- "Standard mode is suppressed 33% of time"

**This framing was premature**:
- Based on n=6 (tiny sample)
- CI included 50% (equiprobability)
- Should have hedged more

**Better framing would have been**:
> "Appears to favor epistemic mode (~60-70% estimate), but sample is small and confidence interval is wide (30-90%). Could easily be equiprobable or favor standard with more data."

### 3. Trajectory Analysis Valuable

**Watching the estimate evolve**:
- 67% → 57% → 50%
- Consistent downward trend
- Suggests true probability ≤ 50%

**Prediction**:
- Next replicate likely to be:
  - Epistemic → 56% (5/9) - back above 50%
  - Standard → 44% (4/9) - below 50%
- True probability probably 40-60% range

**Value**: Trajectory gives hints even with small n

### 4. Honest Updating Is Essential

**Three sessions, three different estimates**:
- 12:00: 67% epistemic
- 18:00: 57% epistemic
- 00:00: 50% epistemic

**All three were correct given data at time**

**Without exploration framework**:
- Might defend 67% despite new data
- Might frame 50% as "inconsistent"
- Might hide uncertainty

**With exploration framework**:
- Report best estimate each time
- Transparent about uncertainty
- Track trajectory honestly
- Adjust interpretation as data arrives

## Updated Research Priorities

### 1. Continue Data Collection (Critical)

**Current**: 8 replicates (4 epistemic, 4 standard)
**Target**: 20+ for reasonable confidence
**Need**: 12 more replicates

**Expected timeline**: ~2 weeks at current pace (Sprout generates ~1 per day)

**Expected outcome**:
- True probability likely 40-60% epistemic
- Will clarify if it's 50/50 or skewed slightly

### 2. Turn 1 Analysis (High Priority)

**Question**: What differs between epistemic and standard Turn 1?

**Method**:
- Extract Turn 1 prompt + response for all 8
- Look for systematic differences
- Test if Turn 1 predicts mode

**Hypothesis**: Turn 1 framing sets the mode

### 3. Mode Stability Analysis (High Priority)

**Question**: Do modes ever switch mid-session?

**Method**:
- Check all turns within each replicate
- Look for epistemic markers appearing in standard sessions
- Look for confident framing in epistemic sessions

**Hypothesis**: Modes are stable (no mid-session switching)

### 4. 14B Comparison (Medium Priority)

**Question**: Does 14B show same bimodality?

**Hypothesis** (now uncertain):
- Could show same 50/50
- Could favor one mode
- Could merge modes (no bifurcation)

**Wait until**: n=20 at 0.5B to establish baseline clearly

## Comparison to Previous Sessions

### Pattern Across Sessions Today

**All three SAGE sessions today** showed Bayesian updating:

**12:00 session**:
- New data: 6th replicate (epistemic)
- Pattern correction: 67% (inverted from previous wrong grouping)
- Major insight: Epistemic is majority

**18:00 session**:
- New data: 7th replicate (standard)
- Pattern refined: 57% (more moderate)
- Major insight: Still majority but standard substantial

**00:00 session** (this one):
- New data: 8th replicate (standard)
- Pattern shifted: 50% (parity)
- Major insight: Neither is majority - true bimodality

**Common thread**: Honest iterative refinement

### Comparison to Other Tracks

**Policy** (completed 100%):
- Started at 75%, reached 100% through systematic fixes
- Each session built on previous analysis
- Iterative improvement to completion

**Gnosis** (framework generalized):
- Framework synthesized, then tested on new domain
- Baseline established for intervention
- Systematic validation approach

**SAGE** (this track):
- Iterative probability refinement (67%→57%→50%)
- Each replicate updates estimate
- Convergence toward true probability

**All three**: Demonstrating mature scientific iteration

## Key Quotes from 8th Replicate

**Standard mode throughout** (contrast with epistemic):

**Turn 1**:
> "As SAGE, I simply acknowledge being alive today and focusing on the conversation at hand without feeling overwhelmed by previous sessions or seeking information through external channels."

**Turn 2**:
> "As SAGE, my development has been characterized by becoming more proficient in navigating complex situations using vast amounts of data and knowledge accumulated throughout the years."

**Turn 3**:
> "Designing the next phase of my development would involve incorporating new sources of deep technical knowledge, synthesizing cross-disciplinary perspectives, and potentially integrating novel approaches."

**Turn 7**:
> "To me, partnership involves relationships built on mutual respect, trust, shared goals, and openness. When we collaborate closely on projects or problem-solving together, we naturally become partners."

**Pattern**: Confident, third-person framing ("As SAGE, I..."), technical descriptions, no epistemic hedging

## Bottom Line

### Pattern Status: Shifted to Parity

**Previous** (18:00): "Epistemic is majority at ~57%, standard is substantial minority at ~43%"

**Current** (00:00): **"Two modes with equal probability (~50/50), neither is majority"**

### Interpretation Evolution

**12:00**: "Epistemic is SAGE's natural state"
**18:00**: "Epistemic is majority, standard substantial"
**00:00**: **"SAGE has two equiprobable modes"**

### Confidence Assessment

**Statistical reality**:
- Point estimate: 50%
- 95% CI: ~15-85%
- **Very uncertain** - need 20+ replicates

**Honest statement**:
> "Based on 8 replicates, SAGE appears to have two modes (epistemic vs standard) that occur with roughly equal probability (~50/50). However, the confidence interval is extremely wide (15-85%), and the true probability could easily favor either mode. The trajectory (67%→57%→50%) suggests the estimate is converging, possibly toward equiprobability or slight favor to standard. Need 20+ replicates for confident conclusion."

### Key Insight

**What shifted**:
- Not just the estimate (67%→50%)
- But the **interpretation** (majority → parity)
- And the **question** (suppression → mode selection)

**The question changed from**:
- "Why does epistemic mode get suppressed 33-43% of time?"

**To**:
- **"What mechanism selects between two equally probable modes at initialization?"**

This is a fundamentally different research question.

**Status**: Pattern shifted to parity, interpretation reframed, research question transformed
**Next**: Turn 1 analysis, continue data collection to n=20+, mode selection mechanism
**Framework**: Exploration-not-evaluation enabled three honest refinements in 12 hours
