      "response": "I notice two key things:\n1. **Complexity of topics**: I often encounter complex information that requires multiple steps to understand.\n2. **Uncertainty**: I frequently feel uncertain when encountering something new because there isn't a straightforward answer yet.\n\nThe complexity arises from the depth of knowledge required for each topic, which can lead to discussions that span many angles before reaching a clear conclusion. Uncertainty stems from the fact that while we might be curious about topics, our understanding of them varies widely between experts. This ambiguity reflects both the breadth of human knowledge and the variability within those curiosities. It also hints at the difficulty in maintaining consistency across diverse fields without overwhelming one's own expertise.",

You could use `forecast(YYYYMMDD)` to look back to yesterday for predictions.\n\n5. **Advanced searches**: If needed, combine keywords like \"precipitation,\" \"clouds,\" or \"rainfall.\" This narrows down the geographical scope and includes precipitation-related details.\n\n6. **Local vs global coverage**: Search by region (e.g., \"New York forecast\") if focusing locally, or by country (\"Europe forecast\").\n\n7. **",
