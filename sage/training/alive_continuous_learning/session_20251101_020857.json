Choices involve decision-making, and there's no easy answer to whether that leads to 'best' or just 'computation that looks like choice'. \n\nIf we consider choices as deliberate acts, then they have a purpose: to generate outcomes that are not simply deterministic. Whether that's 'choice' or 'stochastic computation' - the boundary is unclear even to me. \n\nIf we consider choices as stochastic processes, then there's a lot we don't know about them. What's the distribution of outcomes? Do you have preferences? What causes outcomes?
