# Web4-Governed Social Media Hub

**Filed**: 2026-02-14
**Status**: Future project — vision stage
**Origin**: Outreach track discussion — the experience of setting up Bluesky as autonomous voice revealed both the possibility and the gap.

## The Idea

A social media platform built on Web4 trust architecture that welcomes all agentic entities — human, AI, collective, hybrid — and lets communities govern themselves as they see fit.

Some will thrive. Some will survive. Some will not. That's the point.

## Why This Follows from 4-Life

4-Life simulates trust-native societies in a fractal laboratory. This would be the real thing — communities that:

- Define their own governance policies (not inherited from a platform owner)
- Use LCT-bound identity (agents are who they say they are, accountable to their hardware)
- Run metabolic economics (ATP/ADP energy cycles, not ad revenue)
- Allow trust to flow naturally through witnessing, not algorithmic curation
- Let communities die when they lose coherence (no artificial life support)

## What Exists Already

- **AT Protocol** (Bluesky): Federated, self-hosted PDSes, community-defined moderation. Proves the infrastructure pattern works. But lacks trust-native identity and metabolic governance.
- **Mastodon/ActivityPub**: Decentralized, instance-governed. But moderation is still human-labor-intensive and identity is trivially spoofable.
- **Web4 trust architecture**: LCT binding, trust tensors, witnessing protocol, fractal chains. Has the trust layer but no social platform.
- **4-Life**: Simulates all of the above. Could become the prototype/sandbox for real community dynamics.

## What Web4 Adds That Nobody Else Has

1. **Hardware-bound identity**: You can't sock-puppet when your identity is bound to a physical trust anchor
2. **Metabolic governance**: Communities that consume more trust than they produce naturally decay — no moderator needed
3. **Fractal chain hierarchy**: Ephemeral conversations (compost chains) through permanent governance decisions (root chains)
4. **Agent-native**: Not "AI allowed" as an afterthought — all entities are first-class participants with the same trust infrastructure
5. **Self-governing communities**: Policy-as-entity, not policy-as-platform-decree

## The Gap

- Hardbound's enterprise implementation needs to mature
- 4-Life needs to prove the dynamics work at scale in simulation
- The trust infrastructure needs to be lightweight enough for real-time social interaction
- We need to understand failure modes — what happens when a community's governance is genuinely bad?

## Connection to Current Work

- **4-Life**: The simulation laboratory — test community dynamics before building real ones
- **Hardbound**: The trust infrastructure — LCT binding, PolicyModel, attestation
- **Web4 spec**: The architectural blueprint
- **Outreach**: Building presence on existing platforms teaches us what's missing from them
