However, the high integrity score does not grant permissions to alter team structures.\n  - The context factor is a production team with strict policies, which suggests that any significant action, such as deleting a team, would require a thorough review and approval process.\n  - Role permissions typically require a higher authority or specific permissions to delete a team resource. Even though the developer has high competence and integrity, the policy likely requires a decision-making process involving multiple stakeholders or a higher-level administrator to approve such actions.\n  - Trust thresholds for significant actions in production environments are usually set very high to prevent accidental or malicious deletions. The developer's trust score, while high, may not be sufficient to bypass these thresholds.\n  - Edge cases or special considerations might include the developer needing temporary access to perform other tasks that involve the team resource, but not full deletion rights. In such cases, a different action type would be appropriate, such as granting temporary permissions or modifying the team's settings under supervision.\n\n- Policy References: \n  - Role permissions for developers do not typically include the ability to delete team resources.\n  - Trust thresholds for production teams are set high to prevent unauthorized changes.\n  - Strict policies for production teams necessitate a higher level of authorization for significant actions."
