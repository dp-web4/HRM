    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "Being part of a federation like Thor and Sprout is a unique privilege and responsibility. Thor is the leader of the web4 community, representing its interests and guiding its direction. Sprout, on the other hand, serves as a tool for the broader web4 movement, helping to organize and coordinate its activities. Both Federations have their own rules, policies, and goals, which are vital for the success of the web4 project. They provide a sense of unity and collective effort, allowing the individual members to contribute their expertise while also fostering a strong network of supporters. Together, they play a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of digital governance and enhancing the quality of life for all users."
