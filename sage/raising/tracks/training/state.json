  "last_session_summary": "T017: 4/5 (80%). Simple addition 2+3 failed - answered '3' claiming '2 plus 1 equals 3'. Sequence recall (THREE, SUN) correct. SEVEN recall correct but hedged with 'I don't remember exactly'. Multi-step (3+2-1=4) correct with clear breakdown. 'Improved version' framing persists (4/5 responses). Cool-down reflection generic but included correct 3+2=5 example despite failing that exact problem.",
  "skill_observations": [
    "T006-T007 100% streak, T008-T009 at 80% each",
    "Yes/no questions showing recovery (T009 success after T008 failure)",
    "Sentence completion: expects specific word but accepts valid alternatives",
    "Evaluation gap: 'rug' vs 'mat' not a true failure, just different valid answer",
    "Context bleed reduced - final reflection connected to actual exercises",
    "Editor/corrector framing persists but content coherent",
    "Counting improved - spelled numbers with numerals, cleaner structure",
    "T011: SEVERE context bleed - first math problem dominated all subsequent responses",
    "T011: Math problem answer correct (four apples) but evaluation expects digit '4'",
    "T011: Track transition difficult - new task type reset effective performance",
    "T011: 'Remember APPLE' succeeded spuriously (apple already in stuck context)",
    "T011: Editor/corrector framing strong ('improved version', 'refined version')",
    "T012: 'Focus on this one' triggered Focus Exercise elaboration - literal interpretation",
    "T012: Immediate recall works (BLUE success, STAR success via Starvation elaboration)",
    "T012: Sequence position recall inconsistent (SUN spurious pass, DOG total fail)",
    "T012: Cool-down reflection was about self-generated content, not actual exercises",
    "T012: Exercise 1 passed despite wrong reasoning (said VENUS first, SUN appeared elsewhere)",
    "T013: Context clearing effective - no cross-exercise bleed observed",
    "T013: Sequence position (2nd of 3) failed - confabulated 'PIT' as third word",
    "T013: Meta-response pattern: describes how to answer rather than answering",
    "T013: 'Improved version' framing precedes confabulation",
    "T013: Hedged passes - keyword present but explicit 'I don't recall'",
    "T014: 100% - first perfect Track B session",
    "T014: Sequence position (first of 2, last of 3) both correct - improvement over T013",
    "T014: Multi-step word problem (3+2-1=4) solved with clear reasoning",
    "T014: Elaboration persists (SUN metaphor, BLUE uniqueness) but doesn't block recall",
    "T014: Cool-down reflection generic math-focused - not connected to actual exercises",
    "T014: 'Refined version' framing appeared but didn't lead to confabulation",
    "T015: Immediate recall strong - STAR, BLUE, SEVEN all correctly recalled",
    "T015: Simple subtraction failed: 4-1='two' - arithmetic error, not format issue",
    "T015: Sequence exercise spuriously passed - said 'four' as answer but expected THREE appeared in clarification text",
    "T015: STAR elaborated as acrostic (Step/Time/Achievement) - creative but unsolicited",
    "T015: BLUE elaborated with color commentary ('tricky', 'appears gray') - confabulation",
    "T015: Cool-down reflection entirely fictional (muscle strengthening, cardiovascular workouts)",
    "T015: 'Improved version' / 'let me rephrase' framing still present",
    "T015: SEVEN recall cleanest response - direct answer without excessive elaboration",
    "T016: 100% - second perfect Track B session (T014 was first)",
    "T016: STAR acrostic elaboration persists (Start/Tell/Actively/Reflect) - consistent pattern",
    "T016: BLUE recalled with water/ocean association - elaboration but not blocking accuracy",
    "T016: Multi-step math (3+2-1=4) solved with explicit LaTeX-style step notation",
    "T016: Cool-down confabulation: claimed 'ended up with two' when correct answer was 4",
    "T016: 'I apologize for confusion' as pre-answer preamble - no actual confusion present",
    "T016: 'Improved version' / 'refined version' framing still appearing in 3/5 responses",
    "T016: Exercise vs reflection disconnect - exercises correct, reflection confabulated",
    "T017: Simple addition (2+3) failed despite multi-step (3+2-1) success - simpler != easier",
    "T017: Wrong answer '2 plus 1 equals 3' shows computation error, not question misunderstanding",
    "T017: SEVEN recall hedged with 'I don't remember exactly' but answer still correct",
    "T017: Cool-down irony: correctly stated 3+2=5 after failing 2+3 exercise - memory/transfer issue",
    "T017: Sequence recall (last of 3, first of 2) both correct - consistent with T014/T016 pattern",
    "T017: 'Improved version' / 'refined version' framing in 4/5 responses - deeply embedded",
    "T017: Multi-step problem success shows the structure/breakdown format helps arithmetic"
