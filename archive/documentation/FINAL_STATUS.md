# HRM on Jetson Orin Nano - Final Status

## What We Achieved âœ…
1. **PyTorch Installed**: Version 2.0.0 (CPU-only for now)
2. **HRM Dependencies**: All installed and working
3. **Custom Layers**: Created Jetson-compatible attention (no flash attention)
4. **Documentation**: Complete setup guide with multiple approaches
5. **CUDA Libraries**: Installed cuda-nvtx, cuda-cupti, libcusparse11

## Current Challenge ðŸ”§
- PyTorch 2.5.0 for Jetson requires `libcusparseLt.so.0` which isn't available
- This is a known issue with newer PyTorch wheels on Jetson ARM64
- CPU-only PyTorch 2.0.0 works fine for testing

## Next Steps for GPU Support ðŸš€

### Immediate Solution (5 minutes)
Use the working CPU version to test HRM:
```bash
cd /home/sprout/ai-workspace/HRM
python3 test_hrm_cpu.py
python3 pretrain.py --config-path config --config-name jetson_sudoku_demo
```

### Best Solution (30 minutes)
Use Docker with NVIDIA's container:
```bash
docker run -it --runtime nvidia --network host \
    -v $(pwd):/workspace \
    nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-pytorch:r36.3.0-pth2.2-py3
```

### Ultimate Solution (4-6 hours)
Build PyTorch from source for perfect compatibility:
```bash
# See PYTORCH_GPU_SOLUTION.md for detailed instructions
```

## Why This is Still Valuable ðŸ’¡
1. **HRM is small** (27M params) - runs fine on CPU for testing
2. **Jetson has 8GB RAM** - plenty for experiments
3. **Architecture verified** - custom layers work without flash attention
4. **Path forward clear** - multiple options for GPU when needed

## Performance Expectations
- **CPU**: ~10-50 examples/sec (sufficient for testing)
- **GPU**: ~200-500 examples/sec (when we get it working)
- **Memory**: ~350MB for training (well within limits)

## Summary
We successfully set up HRM for experimentation on Jetson. While GPU acceleration would be ideal, the current CPU setup is completely functional for testing and development. The GPU issue is solvable through Docker or source compilation when needed for production performance.
