## 🔍 Monitoring Training

### Real-time Progress
```bash
cd /home/dp/ai-workspace/HRM/sage/orchestration/groot_arc_setup

# Watch training progress
tail -f training.log

# Check last 50 lines
tail -50 training.log

# Check process status
ps aux | grep train_sage.py

# GPU usage
nvidia-smi
```

### Key Metrics to Watch

**Early Training (Epochs 1-10)**:
- Loss should decrease rapidly (4000 → 2000 → 1000)
- Accuracy should increase (10% → 20% → 30%)
- **Red flag**: Loss not decreasing after 5 epochs

**Mid Training (Epochs 10-50)**:
- Loss continues decreasing (1000 → 500 → 200)
- Accuracy climbs steadily (30% → 50% → 70%)
- Validation accuracy should track training accuracy
- **Red flag**: Training accuracy >> Val accuracy (overfitting)

**Late Training (Epochs 50-100)**:
- Loss plateaus (200 → 150 → 100)
- Accuracy reaches ceiling (70% → 80% → ?)
- Learning rate decays (1e-4 → 1e-5 → 1e-6)
- **Red flag**: Loss increases (divergence)

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### During Training (~27 hours)
1. **Monitor progress** periodically
   - Check training.log every few hours
   - Verify loss is decreasing
   - Watch for any errors

2. **Checkpoints saved automatically**
   - Best model: When validation accuracy improves
   - Periodic: Every 10 epochs
   - Location: `sage/checkpoints/sage_student/`

3. **Let it run**
   - Process is background (survives session close)
   - Machine dedicated to this task
   - No user intervention needed

### After Training Completes
1. **Evaluate best model**
   - Load best_model.pt
   - Test on held-out examples
   - Measure accuracy and speed

2. **Compare with GR00T**
   - Same test set for both models
   - Measure accuracy gap
   - Measure inference speed

3. **Analyze results**
   - Which tasks does SAGE solve?
   - Where does it fail compared to GR00T?
   - Is distillation effective?

4. **Next steps**
   - If good (>80% accuracy): Deploy to production
   - If okay (50-80%): Tune hyperparameters, retrain
   - If poor (<50%): Analyze failures, adjust architecture

## 💡 Key Insights Learned

### Technical Learnings

**GR00T Pipeline**:
- Batching is mandatory (6D video format)
- Collate function converts eagle_content → eagle_* tensors
- Sequence length varies (~5164 tokens for two 900×900 images)
- Features are high quality (mean ~0, std ~2.0, well-normalized)

**SAGE Design**:
- 44M parameters achievable with transformer architecture
- Feature projection (2048 → 512) is critical
- Multi-component loss helps distillation
- Grid decoder needs sufficient capacity (20M params)

**Training Setup**:
- Batch size 8 fits comfortably in 2GB VRAM
- Mixed precision (bfloat16) reduces memory
- Gradient clipping prevents instability
- Cosine annealing helps convergence

### Implementation Philosophy

**User's Guidance**:
> "remember, no shortcuts - we want actual meaningful solutions"
> "let's start with option a and learn. do whatever is necessary, this machine is fully dedicated to the task and we have time."

**What We Did**:
- ✅ Used real GR00T model and pipeline (not mocks)
- ✅ Extracted real features from real data
- ✅ Implemented proper training infrastructure
- ✅ Validated every step thoroughly
- ✅ Documented everything comprehensively

**Key Principles**:
1. Read the source code when docs unclear
2. Test each component independently
3. Validate with small batches first
4. Document design decisions
5. Use real data, never shortcuts
