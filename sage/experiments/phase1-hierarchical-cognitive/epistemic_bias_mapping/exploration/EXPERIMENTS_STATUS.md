# Exploration Experiments Status

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: Running

---

## Experiments Overview

### 1. WeightWatcher Comparison
**Script**: `exploration/weightwatcher_comparison.py`
**Purpose**: Analyze weight distributions across Original Qwen → Phase 1 → Phase 2.1
**Status**: ⏳ Running (bash_id: 13e2bb)
**Expected Runtime**: 15-20 minutes
**Started**: ~3:48 PM

**What it tests**:
- Alpha (power law exponent) - generalization capacity
- Log norm (model complexity) - regularization quality
- Spectral norm (stability) - training stability
- Comparison deltas between models

### 2. Phase 1 IRP Test
**Script**: `exploration/test_phase1_with_irp.py`
**Purpose**: Test epistemic-pragmatism with full SAGE-IRP scaffolding
**Status**: ⏳ Running (bash_id: aad1bf)
**Expected Runtime**: 5-10 minutes
**Started**: ~3:48 PM

**What it tests**:
- Does Phase 1 maintain epistemic humility WITH scaffolding?
- Energy convergence patterns vs. Phase 2.1
- Trust evolution through conversation
- Coherence with proper cognitive infrastructure

## Critical Discovery Fixed

### Issue Identified
Both scripts initially failed because:
- Phase 1 model was saved as **merged model** (not PEFT adapter)
- Scripts tried to load with `PeftModel.from_pretrained()`
- Missing `adapter_config.json` caused failure

### Fix Implemented
1. **Updated weightwatcher_comparison.py**: Loads Phase 1 directly as merged model
2. **Updated test_phase1_with_irp.py**: Passes `is_merged_model=True` flag
3. **Updated introspective_qwen_impl.py plugin**: Handles both merged and PEFT models

### Model Locations
- **Phase 1 (merged)**: `fine_tuned_model/final_model/` (local)
- **Phase 2.1 (PEFT)**: `Introspective-Qwen-0.5B-v2.1/model/` (local)
- **Original Qwen**: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` (HuggingFace)

## Next Steps (After Completion)

1. ✅ **Scripts Fixed** - All loading issues resolved
2. ⏳ **Tests Running** - Both experiments in progress
3. ⏸️ **Analyze Results** - Compare Phase 1 vs Phase 2.1 behavior
4. ⏸️ **Update Documentation** - Add findings to META_REFLECTION
5. ⏸️ **Commit to Git** - Push corrected scripts and results
6. ⏸️ **Share with User** - Available remotely via GitHub

## Key Questions Being Answered

1. **Weight Distribution**: What did training actually change in the models?
2. **Scaffolding Effect**: Does Phase 1 (humility training) behave differently than Phase 2.1 with full cognitive infrastructure?
3. **Energy Convergence**: Do the models converge to different energy levels?
4. **Trust Learning**: Does trust evolution differ between models?

**Current Time**: 3:51 PM
**Estimated Completion**: 4:05-4:10 PM

Monitoring in progress. Will update with results once experiments complete.
