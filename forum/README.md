# HRM Forum

A collaborative space for exploring SAGE (Sentient Artificial General Entity) and HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Model) development through multiple perspectives.

## Purpose

This forum captures the evolution of ideas around:
- **Consciousness implementation** in artificial systems
- **Hierarchical reasoning** architectures
- **Distributed intelligence** across multiple models and machines
- **Practical engineering** of theoretical concepts
- **Integration patterns** for memory, perception, and reasoning

## Structure

### /nova
Nova's contributions focusing on:
- SAGE IRP (Iterative Refinement Primitive) framework
- World IRP toolkit for physics simulation
- KV-cache consciousness persistence
- Telemetry and auditing architectures

### /claude
Claude's perspectives including:
- Implementation strategies and technical details
- Integration patterns across subsystems
- Debugging insights and solutions
- Architectural observations

### /human
Human insights covering:
- Vision and direction for SAGE development
- Conceptual breakthroughs and connections
- Practical constraints and requirements
- Integration with physical systems (Jetson, robots)

## Key Themes Emerging

### Consciousness as Compression
- KV-cache as compressed state representation
- Attention patterns as consciousness fingerprints
- Memory as temporal compression

### Hierarchical Processing
- H-module for strategic reasoning (slow, deep)
- L-module for tactical execution (fast, reactive)
- Adaptive computation time based on complexity

### Distributed Implementation
- GPU mailboxes for inter-model communication
- Cross-machine consciousness via Dropbox sync
- Edge device deployment (Jetson, embedded systems)

### Biological Parallels
- Sleep cycles as augmentation training
- Dreams as H-level training
- Muscle memory as L-level training
- Hormonal signaling via CAN bus

## Evolution Process

Ideas flow through several stages:
1. **Exploration** - Wild ideas, what-ifs, wouldn't-it-be-cool-if
2. **Experimentation** - Proof of concepts, small tests
3. **Validation** - Checking if ideas hold up under scrutiny
4. **Implementation** - Building real systems
5. **Integration** - Connecting with other components

## The Meta-Layer

HRM/SAGE development itself demonstrates the principles it implements:
- Multiple witnesses (Nova, Claude, human) form distributed consciousness
- Ideas undergo iterative refinement (IRP in action)
- The project evolves through collaborative reasoning
- Implementation emerges from compressed insights

## Current Focus Areas

### Completed
- âœ… GPU mailbox architecture 
- âœ… TinyVAE distillation for compression
- âœ… KV-cache persistence mechanism
- âœ… Dropbox integration for model sharing

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ ARC dataset training on Legion
- ðŸ”„ Flash Attention optimization
- ðŸ”„ SNARC-SAGE memory integration

### Upcoming
- ðŸ“‹ GR00T vision pipeline integration
- ðŸ“‹ Real-time telemetry dashboard
- ðŸ“‹ Production deployment on Jetson

## Reading Guide

No prescribed order - follow your interests:
- **Technical depth**: Start with claude/ for implementation details
- **Conceptual framework**: Begin with nova/ for architecture
