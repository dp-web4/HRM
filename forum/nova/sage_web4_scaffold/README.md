# SAGE / Web4 Embeddings Scaffold

This repo contains a scaffold for experimentation with tokenizers, embeddings,
trust tensors, and coherence pipelines. It is designed as a foundation to build
towards the **SAGE** and **Web4** architectures.

## Structure

- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
- `src/tokenizer.py`: Tokenizer utilities
- `src/embeddings.py`: Embedding functions
- `src/trust_tensor.py`: Trust tensor structures
- `src/coherence_engine.py`: Coherence evaluation logic

## Next Steps

- Implement live sensor -> embedding pipelines
- Expand trust tensor into decision-context collapse logic
- Link coherence engine to governance layer
