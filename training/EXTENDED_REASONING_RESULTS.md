# Extended Reasoning Fine-Tuning Results

## Executive Summary
The extended reasoning fine-tuning experiment (8‚Üí20 cycles) **failed to improve performance**. In fact, it severely degraded the model's accuracy from 49.1% to 8.1% on ARC-AGI-1.

## Results Overview

| Model Version | Reasoning Cycles | AGI-1 Accuracy | Change |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| Original (7K steps) | 8 | 49.1% | Baseline |
| Fine-tuned (1K steps) | 20 | 9.2% | -81% |
| Fine-tuned (10K steps) | 20 | 8.1% | -83% |

## What Happened?

### The Good
- ‚úÖ Fixed halt predictor initialization issue
- ‚úÖ Model successfully used all 20 reasoning cycles
- ‚úÖ Training completed without errors
- ‚úÖ Halt probabilities showed proper gradual progression

### The Bad
- ‚ùå Catastrophic performance degradation (49% ‚Üí 8%)
- ‚ùå Performance got worse with more training (9.2% ‚Üí 8.1%)
- ‚ùå Model essentially became random (8% is near random for 10 colors)
- ‚ùå Extended reasoning didn't help - it hurt

## Analysis: Why Did Extended Reasoning Fail?

### 1. Overfitting to Training Process
The model was trained with extended reasoning but evaluated on tasks that might not need it. Forcing 20 cycles on every task likely:
- Added unnecessary complexity to simple tasks
- Introduced noise through excessive computation
- Disrupted the learned patterns from original training

### 2. Training Data Mismatch
- **Original training**: 500x augmented data with 8 cycles
- **Fine-tuning**: Non-augmented data with 20 cycles
- The dramatic shift in both data and reasoning depth was too much

### 3. Computational Overhead Without Benefit
For many ARC tasks, 8 cycles is sufficient. Forcing 20 cycles:
- Doesn't add value if the answer is found early
- May cause the model to "overthink" and change correct answers
- Adds 2.5x computational cost with negative returns

### 4. Loss Function Issues
The loss function tried to balance:
- Task accuracy (main objective)
- Halt timing (when to stop)
- Cycle usage (how many steps)

This multi-objective optimization likely confused the model, especially with the dramatic architecture change.

## Key Insights

### Extended Reasoning ‚â† Better Reasoning
Simply giving the model more cycles doesn't make it smarter. The model needs:
1. **Adaptive reasoning**: Use cycles when needed, not always
2. **Task-appropriate depth**: Simple tasks need fewer cycles
3. **Gradual training**: Can't jump from 8 to 20 cycles suddenly

### The 49% Baseline Is Actually Good
Our attempts to improve through:
- Extended reasoning (20 cycles): 8.1% ‚ùå
- Original fine-tuning (broken): 9.2% ‚ùå
- **Original model remains best**: 49.1% ‚úÖ

This suggests the original training found a good local optimum that's hard to improve through simple modifications.

### Architecture vs Training
The HRM architecture with 8 cycles is well-balanced. Changes need to be:
- Gradual (8‚Üí10‚Üí12, not 8‚Üí20)
- With appropriate data (keep augmentation)
- Carefully validated at each step

## Comparison with Original Hypothesis

**We hypothesized**: "Extended reasoning (20 cycles) will help with complex multi-step tasks"

**Reality**: The model performed worse on ALL tasks, not just simple ones

This suggests:
1. The original 8-cycle limit wasn't the bottleneck
2. The model lacks the capacity to use extra cycles effectively
3. More fundamental architectural changes are needed

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't fix what isn't broken**: The 8-cycle limit was appropriate for the model size
2. **Gradual changes**: Large jumps (8‚Üí20) destabilize training
3. **Validate assumptions**: We assumed more cycles = better reasoning, but this was false
4. **Preserve what works**: The original training regime was well-tuned

## Next Steps Recommendations

### Don't Pursue
- ‚ùå Further extended reasoning experiments
- ‚ùå Dramatic architectural changes to existing model
- ‚ùå Fine-tuning without augmented data

### Consider Instead
- ‚úÖ Scale model size (6.95M ‚Üí 27M parameters)
- ‚úÖ Keep original 8-cycle architecture
- ‚úÖ Maintain augmentation strategy
- ‚úÖ Focus on better training data quality

## Final Verdict

**Extended reasoning failed completely.** The original model with 8 cycles and 49.1% accuracy remains our best performer. The attempt to improve through extended reasoning resulted in an 83% performance drop.

The key takeaway: **More computation ‚â† better reasoning**. The model needs more capacity (parameters) and better training, not just more cycles.

### Performance Summary
- **Original model (8 cycles)**: 49.1% - Still champion üèÜ
- **Extended reasoning (20 cycles)**: 8.1% - Complete failure ‚ùå
- **Conclusion**: Stick with original architecture
