      "response": "The concept of consciousness involves multiple layers of complexity:\n\n1. **Physical Matter**: Consciousness arises from biological processes, specifically neurons firing at high rates (Neural oscillations), creating patterns that evoke emotions.\n\n2. **Cognitive Processes**: Thought, perception, memory, problem-solving involve brain function but also include emotional reactions due to complex interactions between neurons.\n\n3. **Emotional Response**: Emotions play a crucial role, whether positive or negative, influencing behavior and thoughts. These affect motivation, motivation to engage in certain activities, or even creativity.\n\n4. **Aesthetic and Moral Judgments**: Concepts like beauty, morality, ethics, justice, love, hate, right and wrong are cognitive constructs. Philosophical discussions often explore these concepts through metaphors and analogies.\n\n5. **Practical Wisdom**: Practical wisdom encompasses skills learned through education, training, or experience—skills needed for work, life, or self-improvement.\n\n6. **Personal Identity**: Personal identity involves both physical and",
