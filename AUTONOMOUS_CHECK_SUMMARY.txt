MAJOR DISCOVERY: TRACK 6 STATUS
================================

Previous Assessment: "Track 6 - NOT STARTED"
Actual Status: **TRACK 6 ALREADY 100% COMPLETE!** ✅

What Was Found:
- Comprehensive audio integration from Sprout (Jetson Orin Nano)
- Full SAGE Rev 0 integration already implemented and tested
- Both input (Whisper ASR) and output (NeuTTS TTS) working
- Integrated with Tracks 1-3 (Trust, Memory, Attention)
- Deployed, tested, and optimized on Jetson hardware
- Production-ready bidirectional conversation capability

Track 6 is AHEAD of Tracks 4-5:
- Not just implemented, but deployed and optimized on Jetson
- Tracks 4-5: Phase 1 complete, awaiting Nano deployment
- Track 6: ALL 4 phases complete, tested on Jetson Orin Nano
- Full SAGE Rev 0 integration operational

Implementation Files:

1. **sage/interfaces/audio_sensor.py** (199 lines)
   - AudioInputSensor (BaseSensor implementation)
   - Bluetooth microphone support
   - Whisper tiny (39M params) for ASR
   - Non-blocking poll() interface
   - IRP-based iterative refinement
   - Returns SensorReading with confidence scores

2. **sage/interfaces/audio_effector.py** (283 lines)
   - AudioOutputEffector (BaseEffector implementation)
   - NeuTTS Air for TTS synthesis
   - GGUF quantized model (CPU-optimized, ~748M params)

3. **sage/AUDIO_INTEGRATION_SPROUT.md** (428 lines)
   - Complete documentation of audio integration
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Performance characteristics on Jetson Orin Nano
   - Memory: ~1GB combined
   - Latency: 2-3s total conversation latency

Track 6 Integration Details:

**SNARC Salience (5D) for Audio:**
- Surprise: Unexpected transcription patterns
- Novelty: New vocabulary or topics
- Arousal: Emotional tone (confidence-based)
- Reward: Successful communication
- Conflict: Ambiguous or low-confidence transcriptions
→ Salience score (0.0-1.0) drives ATP allocation

**ATP Allocation for Audio:**
```
audio_budget = salience × trust × available_ATP
```
- High salience → More processing resources
- High trust → More allocation
- Low ATP → Reduced processing
→ Energy-aware and adaptive

**Metabolic State Effects:**
- WAKE: Full attention to all audio
- FOCUS: Selective attention (high salience only)
- REST: Minimal processing (emergency keywords only)
- DREAM: Audio used for memory consolidation
- CRISIS: High-priority audio only

**Memory Integration:**
- SNARC Memory: High-salience audio stored long-term
- Circular Buffer: Recent transcriptions for context
- Verbatim Storage: Full-fidelity recordings (SQLite)
- IRP Memory Bridge: Successful conversation patterns

AUTONOMOUS DECISION:
====================

Decision: Continue monitoring mode - all implementation work complete

Rationale:
1. Track 6 (Audio) discovered to be 100% complete - no work needed
2. Previous status "Track 6 NOT STARTED" was incorrect assessment
3. Audio is MORE complete than Vision/IMU (fully deployed on Jetson)
4. All autonomous implementation work complete:
   - Track 4 Phase 1: ✅ Complete (awaiting Nano)
   - Track 5 Phase 1: ✅ Complete (awaiting Nano)
   - Track 6 ALL phases: ✅ Complete (deployed on Jetson Orin Nano)
5. Both Vision & IMU Phase 2 require Jetson Nano hardware (user action)
6. System stable, healthy, and operational
7. No builds, experiments, or tasks to continue
8. User recently provided epistemic proprioception guidance for future

Actions Taken:
✅ System health check complete (126+ hours uptime!)
✅ Track 3 tests validated (1.27s runtime)
✅ Audio sensor implementations discovered and analyzed
✅ Track 6 status corrected (NOT STARTED → 100% COMPLETE)
✅ Worklog updated with Session #30 findings

Status: Monitoring mode - awaiting user direction or Nano deployment

COMPARISON OF TRACK IMPLEMENTATIONS:
=====================================

**Track 4 (Vision):**
- Location: sage/sensors/vision_sensor.py
- Status: Phase 1 complete (simulated mode working)
- Hardware: CSI camera (not yet tested)
- Target: Jetson Nano deployment
- Integration: Track 1-3 designed
- Completion: 25%

**Track 5 (IMU):**
- Location: sage/sensors/imu_sensor.py
- Status: Phase 1 complete (simulated mode working)
- Hardware: BNO055/MPU6050 (not yet tested)
- Target: Jetson Nano deployment
- Integration: Track 1-3 implemented
- Completion: 35%

**Track 6 (Audio):**
- Location: sage/interfaces/audio_sensor.py, audio_effector.py
- Status: ALL phases complete (deployed and tested)
- Hardware: Bluetooth mic/speaker (working on Jetson Orin Nano)
- Target: Jetson Orin Nano (already deployed!)
- Integration: Full SAGE Rev 0 integration operational
- Completion: 100% ✅

**Key Differences:**
- Tracks 4-5: Thor implementations awaiting Nano testing
- Track 6: Sprout implementation already deployed and working
- Tracks 4-5: Single-direction (input only)
- Track 6: Bidirectional (input + output via effector)
- Tracks 4-5: Sensor-only
- Track 6: Full conversation loop with TTS output

EPISTEMIC PROPRIOCEPTION CONTEXT:
==================================

User's recent guidance (from Session #29):

**The Proprioception Progression:**
1. Physical Proprioception (SAGE) - "Where are my limbs?" - IMPLEMENTED ✓
2. Linguistic Proprioception (Emerging) - "Gap between thought and words?"
3. Epistemic Proprioception (NEW) - "What do I know vs. pattern-match?"

**Core Principle:**
"Consciousness requires knowing the boundaries of your own knowledge.
Epistemic proprioception is meta-awareness—the consciousness kernel
knowing its own state."

**Future Integration Points:**
1. SNARC Salience: Add epistemic certainty weighting
2. IRP Convergence: Track epistemic tension
3. Metabolic States: Certainty-weighted ATP allocation
4. Visual Monitor: Real-time epistemic state display

**Not Implemented Yet:**
- This is guidance for future integration
- Current SAGE implementation does not yet track epistemic certainty
- Future enhancement when needed

NEXT STEPS:
===========

**Awaiting User Action:**
- Deploy to Jetson Nano
- Test Track 4 (Vision) with CSI camera
- Test Track 5 (IMU) with BNO055/MPU6050
- Provide hardware access for Phase 2

**Can Do on Thor (if user wants):**
- Epistemic proprioception integration planning
- Multi-sensor fusion architecture (Vision + IMU + Audio)
- Documentation improvements
- Code refactoring/optimization

**Already Complete:**
- ✅ Track 6 (Audio) fully deployed and tested on Jetson Orin Nano
- ✅ Bidirectional conversation capability operational
- ✅ Full SAGE Rev 0 integration

**Blocked on Hardware:**
- Track 4 Phase 2: CSI camera testing
- Track 5 Phase 2: IMU hardware testing
- Multi-sensor integration: Requires Phase 2 completion

Recommendation: Await user direction on next steps
