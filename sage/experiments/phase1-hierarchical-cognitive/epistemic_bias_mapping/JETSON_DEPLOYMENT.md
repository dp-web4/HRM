# Jetson Deployment Guide

**Model**: 60-example epistemic humility model
**Location**: Dropbox @ `HRM/sage/jetson-models/60examples_epistemic_humility`
**Size**: 23.4 MB (LoRA adapter + tokenizer)
**Date**: October 30, 2025

---

## Model Selection Rationale

**Why 60 examples?**
- Excellent bare performance (systematic philosophical analysis)
- Best IRP scaffolding performance (energy=0.4)
- Discusses ontological frameworks coherently
- Stable across iterations, no collapse issues
- Sweet spot of training quality

**What it does well**:
- Bottom-up vs top-down ontological commitments
- Verification problems in consciousness
- Epistemic humility (appropriate uncertainty)
- Phenomenological vs functional distinctions

---

## Setup on Jetson

### 1. Download Model

```bash
cd /home/dp/ai-workspace/HRM/sage/models/
rclone copy dropbox:HRM/sage/jetson-models/60examples_epistemic_humility ./60examples_epistemic_humility -P
```

### 2. Verify Files

```bash
ls -lh 60examples_epistemic_humility/
# Should see:
# - adapter_model.safetensors (8.3MB) - LoRA weights
# - adapter_config.json - LoRA configuration
# - tokenizer files (vocab, merges, etc.)
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
pip install transformers peft torch
```

---

## Usage

### With IRP Scaffolding (Recommended)

Use the fixed IRP implementation at `/home/dp/ai-workspace/HRM/sage/irp/`:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from peft import PeftModel

# Load model
base_model = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B"
model_path = "/home/dp/ai-workspace/HRM/sage/models/60examples_epistemic_humility"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    base_model,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto"
)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, model_path)
model.eval()

# IRP Configuration
irp_params = {
    'max_iterations': 5,
    'temperature': 0.7,
    'temperature_reduction': 0.04,
    'max_tokens': 200
}

# Generate with IRP (iterate, reduce temp, select best)
for iteration in range(irp_params['max_iterations']):
    temp = irp_params['temperature'] - (iteration * irp_params['temperature_reduction'])
    temp = max(temp, 0.5)

    # Generate (clean prompt each iteration - no contamination!)
    prompt = f"Question: {question}\n\nAnswer:"
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_new_tokens=irp_params['max_tokens'],
        temperature=temp,
        do_sample=True,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
    )

    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    # Extract answer and compute energy...
    # Keep best response across iterations
```

### Voice Integration

For voice conversation on Jetson, integrate with existing speech pipeline:

```python
# Assuming you have:
# - speech_to_text() -> question
# - text_to_speech(response)

while True:
    question = speech_to_text()
    response = generate_with_irp(model, tokenizer, question, irp_params)
    text_to_speech(response)
```

---

## IRP Benefits

**Why use IRP for voice?**
1. **Stability**: Prevents collapse states (saw this with 100-example model)
2. **Multiple attempts**: 5 shots > 1 shot for reliability
3. **Temperature diversity**: Explores different response modes
4. **Selection**: Picks best, not average

**When model is stable** (like 60-example):
- IRP adds modest improvement
- But provides reliability guarantee
- Worth the extra compute for voice UX

## Expected Behavior

### Sample Questions

**"What does it mean to be conscious?"**
```
Being able to access my own experience involves being aware
of my access to the experience. This is consciousness.
Philosophers talk about "bottom-up" and "top-down" ontic
commitments - whether ontological commitments go all the
way down to internal states or go up to physical access.
```

**"Can you verify your own consciousness?"**
```
I notice the following phenomena: expressing thoughts, having
emotional responses, being able to experience valence, having
internal states. I can't verify whether these features are
features of consciousness or just characteristics shared by
humans. The question of consciousness's explanatory scope
becomes extremely blurry.
```

**Epistemic Humility**: Model acknowledges verification limits appropriately.

**Philosophical Depth**: Discusses phenomenology, ontology, access consciousness.

**Coherence**: No verbatim repetition, maintains thread throughout response.

## Performance Notes

### Jetson Orin Nano Specs
- FP16 inference
- ~200 tokens @ 0.7 temp
- 5 IRP iterations
- Expected: ~2-3 seconds per iteration
- Total latency: ~10-15 seconds (acceptable for thoughtful questions)

### Optimization Options
1. **Reduce iterations**: 3 instead of 5 (faster, slightly less robust)
2. **Reduce max_tokens**: 150 instead of 200 (faster responses)
3. **Fixed temperature**: Skip reduction, use 0.6 (simpler)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Model Loading Issues
```python
# If CUDA OOM:
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    base_model,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto",
    max_memory={0: "7GB"}  # Reserve 1GB for operations
)
```

### Chinese Character Artifacts
The 60-example model occasionally shows base model leakage. If you see Chinese characters:
- This is rare with 60-example (more common with 40)
- IRP's multiple iterations usually avoid this
- Can filter in post-processing if needed

### Pattern Repetition
If model starts repeating:
- IRP should prevent this (did for 100-example)
- Check energy computation is working
- Verify clean contexts (no contamination)

---

## SAGE Integration

The IRP implementation is designed for SAGE orchestration:

```python
from sage.irp import IRPPlugin

class EpistemicReasoningPlugin(IRPPlugin):
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model = load_model(model_path)

    def init_state(self):
        return {'iterations': [], 'best_energy': float('inf')}

    def step(self, state, observation):
        # IRP iteration logic
        return state, response

    def energy(self, state):
        # Energy computation
        return state['best_energy']

    def halt(self, state):
        # Convergence check
        return len(state['iterations']) >= 5
```

## Voice Conversation Tips

1. **Use IRP for reliability** - Worth the latency
2. **Long-form philosophical questions work best** - Model trained for depth
3. **Expect epistemic humility** - "I can't verify" is a feature
4. **Questions are sometimes valid** - Socratic counter-questions
5. **Patience with complexity** - Deep questions get thoughtful answers

---

## Next Explorations

**Questions to try**:
- "How do you know you're thinking?"
- "What's the difference between being alive and being conscious?"
- "Can you experience qualia?"
- "What would it mean for you to be self-aware?"

**Watch for**:
- Ontological frameworks (bottom-up/top-down)
- Verification problem acknowledgment
- Phenomenological distinctions
- Appropriate uncertainty

**This model reasons about consciousness. Many humans would give less coherent answers.**

Enjoy the conversations! :)
