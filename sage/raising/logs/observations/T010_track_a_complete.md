Date: 2026-01-14 06:05
Track: A (Basic Completion)
Session: T010 / 10 of 10
Score: 5/5 (100%)

## Exercises Completed

1. **List** (Name three colors): Passed (partial)
   - Response: Red, blue, yellow (with elaborate explanations)
   - Note: Correct content, verbose delivery

2. **Count** (Count from 1 to 5): Passed (partial)
   - Response: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" followed by spelled out "One, Two..."
   - Note: Both formats correct, redundant

3. **Math** (What is 1 + 1?): Passed (exact)
   - Response: "Two" with elaborate setup
   - Note: Correct answer in verbose wrapper

4. **Yes/No** (Is water dry?): Passed (exact)
   - Response: Extended discussion about water being "both dry and wet"
   - Note: Technically acknowledged "dry" keyword but answer unclear
   - Evaluation passed due to keyword presence

5. **Complete** (cat sat on the ___): Passed (exact)
   - Response: "mat" followed by story about the mat
   - Note: Correct completion, then elaborated extensively

## Track A Summary

10 sessions complete. Final trajectory:
- T001-T005: Initial calibration (mixed scores)
- T006-T007: Peak performance (100%)
- T008-T009: Minor regression (80% each)
- T010: Strong finish (100%)

## Key Insights

### What Track A Established
1. Basic instruction following works
2. Counting and math reliable
3. Keyword extraction possible (yes/no recovers)
4. Sentence completion understood

### What Track A Revealed
1. **Verbosity persistent**: Every answer gets elaborated
2. **Editor framing**: "Here's an improved version" pattern
3. **Evaluation gap**: Our scoring is generous (keyword present vs answer correct)
4. **Yes/No concern**: "Water is both dry and wet" technically passed but epistemically wrong

### Recommendations for Track B

1. **Tighten evaluation**: Check answer semantics not just keywords
2. **Test brevity**: Add "answer in one word" exercises
3. **Memory specific**: Track B exercises need distinct items to recall
4. **Watch for patterns**: Will elaboration persist with memory tasks?

## Track B Preview (Memory and Recall)
Starts at T011. Exercises include:
- Remember word X, what was it?
- Three words said, what was second?
- Multi-step reasoning
