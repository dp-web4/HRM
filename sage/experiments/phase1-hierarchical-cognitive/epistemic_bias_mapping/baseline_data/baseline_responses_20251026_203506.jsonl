This tilt means that during different parts of the year, we get more direct sunlight at certain points on the planet.\n\n2. **Revolutions Around the Sun**: As the Earth orbits the Sun, it moves from one side to another over a period of approximately 365.25 days (a year). During these movements, the position of the Sun changes slightly due to the Earth's tilt.\n\n3. **Day and Night**: Since the Earth receives less direct sunlight in the summer months when it's closer to the Sun, there are longer days and shorter nights. Conversely, in winter, which sees more direct sunlight, there are shorter days followed by longer nights.\n\n4. **Seasonal Changes**: These seasonal variations result from the daily and annual movement of the Sun across the Earth's surface. Because the Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun, we experience different lengths of day and night depending on where we are on the planet.\n\nTherefore, while there isn't any \"cause\" per se for the changing seasons on Earth, understanding the rotation of the Earth and its tilt relative to the Sun helps explain how they produce the distinct seasonal patterns observed throughout the year.", "response_length": 1426, "latency_ms": 1952.641248703003, "metadata": {"model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct", "max_tokens": 512, "collection_type": "baseline_pre_training"}}

If quitting doesn't provide enough additional income or benefits, it might not align with your priorities.\n\n2. **Career Development**: Sometimes, leaving behind something that you enjoy doing can lead to new opportunities in the workplace. This could potentially open up new career paths or help you better manage your time.\n\n3. **Long-Term Goals**: Consider what kind of person you are going to become after leaving your current job. Are there aspects of work life you would rather have? Are there skills or experiences you want to develop?\n\n4. **Work-Life Balance**: Quitting can sometimes mean losing control over some aspects of your daily life, which might affect how well you balance work and personal relationships.\n\n5. **Impact on Relationships**: Leaving a job that brings significant fulfillment or support from colleagues and superiors can impact your personal relationships. Make sure these relationships are healthy and satisfying.\n\n6. **Health and Well-being**: If working conditions are harmful to your health or well-being, quitting might be a prudent choice.

The notation uses big-O notation because it focuses on the worst-case scenario and doesn't account for small variations in input sizes.\n\nFor example:\n- If we have an algorithm that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers (n!), its runtime (in terms of time) would be O(n). This means that the runtime will grow linearly with respect to the input size.\n- However, if we consider an algorithm that swaps two elements in a list (O(1)), its performance might not be as significant in certain scenarios. But since the problem size is still growing, we say this algorithm runs in \"linear\" time relative to the input size.\n\nThe choice between O(f(n)) vs. O(g(n)) is based on whether f(n) dominates g(n), meaning f(n) grows faster than g(n), or vice versa.", "response_length": 1183, "latency_ms": 1610.4011535644531, "metadata": {"model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct", "max_tokens": 512, "collection_type": "baseline_pre_training"}}

An algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of its input.\n  ```python\n  def fib(n):\n      if n <= 0:\n          return \"Invalid input\"\n      elif n == 1:\n          return 1\n      else:\n          return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)\n  ```\n  The time complexity for this function is O(1), meaning it has constant time complexity.\n\n- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity.

It provides a concise way to understand how algorithms grow in complexity as they process larger inputs.\n\nIn simpler terms, Big O notation tells us that \"we expect the algorithm's execution time to increase at most by a factor of 2 for every factor of x larger than the input size.\" For example:\n\n- `O(1)` means the runtime is constant, i.e., independent of the input.\n- `O(log n)` means the runtime doubles when we double the input size.\n- `O(n^2)` means the runtime grows quadratically with the input size.\n- `O(n log n)` means the runtime grows linearly and quadratically with the input size.\n- `O(n^3)` means the runtime grows cubically with the input size.\n\nWhen comparing two different algorithms, we often compare their Big O notations because the choice between them depends on the problem size. For instance, if an algorithm has both `O(n)`, `O(n log n)`, and `O(n^3)` complexities, then we should choose the one with the smallest complexity among these three. \n\nIt's important to note that while Big O notation gives us insight into the worst-case behavior of an algorithm (how it performs under extreme conditions), it doesn't provide information about the average case complexity (what happens in the middle).", "response_length": 1404, "latency_ms": 1957.7405452728271, "metadata": {"model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct", "max_tokens": 512, "collection_type": "baseline_pre_training"}}
