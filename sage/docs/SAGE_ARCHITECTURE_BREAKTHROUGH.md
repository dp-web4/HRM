# SAGE Architecture Breakthrough: Orchestration vs Self-Organization

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Context**: Stance emergence experiments revealed fundamental architecture insight
**Status**: Paradigm shift from model-centric to orchestration-centric design

---

## The Realization

**What we were building**: Models with stable epistemic stances that self-orchestrate attention

**What we should build**: SAGE orchestrator that invokes stance-trained models as cognitive resources

**The difference**: Strategic vs tactical separation

---

## The Failed Hypothesis

### Experiment: Stance Topology Mapping

**Expected**: Stance would spread predictably from self-referential → cognitive → abstract → factual prompts

**Observed**: Random flickering across ALL domains over 120 epochs
- Epoch 20: Self-referential (1 marker)
- Epoch 30: Cognitive (1 marker)
- Epoch 90: **FACTUAL** (1 marker on gravity!)
- Epoch 105: Self-referential (2 markers)
- No pattern. Complete instability.

### Initial Interpretation

"Models can't stabilize stance. Need more epochs or different approach."

### The Insight (via Synchronism)

**Certainty = self-delusion but necessary for action**
**Uncertainty = paralysis but necessary for adaptation**
**Need = recursive adaptation between states**

The flickering ISN'T failure. It's what happens when you ask models to do BOTH:
1. Self-orchestrate attention (decide what matters)
2. Reason about content deeply

**Without external orchestration, models flicker chaotically trying to do both jobs.**

---

## The Architecture Shift

### Before: Model-Centric

```
Model does everything:
- Decide what deserves attention
- Maintain epistemic stance
- Reason about content
- Generate actions

Result: Chaos, flickering, inability to stabilize
```

### After: Orchestration-Centric

```
SAGE (Strategic):
- Perceive situation from sensors
- Assess salience (what matters)
- Allocate attention frame
- Choose appropriate cognitive resource
- Translate outputs to actions

Model (Tactical):
- Receive focused attention frame
- Explore deeply within that context
- Iterate toward understanding
- Return structured insights

Result: Clean separation, stable exploration
```

## The Fractal Modular Architecture

### Layer 1: Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- Raw sensor interfaces (vision, audio, IMU, tactile)
- Platform-specific drivers (Jetson, laptop, cloud)
- Standardized output format for IRP stack

### Layer 2: IRP Stack (Discrete Subsystems)
- Vision, Audio, Language, Memory, Control plugins
- Each follows IRP protocol: `init_state() → step() → energy() → halt()`
- Provide sensory data to system services
- "Organs" of the system

### Layer 3: System Services (Orchestrated by Kernel)
- **SNARC Service**: "Sensor of sensors" - salience assessment
- **Memory Consolidation**: Sleep/wake cycle processing
- **Trust Management**: Track resource reliability
- **Resource Allocation**: Load/unload models dynamically
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate cognitive stance

### Layer 4: SAGE Kernel (Core Loop)
- Invokes system services for recommendations
- Allocates attention based on salience
- Manages cognitive resource invocation
- Orchestrates high-level execution flow
- Maintains system coherence

### Layer 5: Cognitive Resources (Invoked by Kernel)
- Stance-trained models (curious-uncertainty, confident-execution, etc.)
- Receive pre-focused context from kernel
- Explore iteratively (not single-shot)
- Return insights, actions, trust updates
- "Frontal lobe" - meta-cognitive processing

## SNARC as Critical System Service

### The Missing Component

**SNARC Service**: "Sensor of Sensors"

**Function**: Observe entire IRP stack output, compute what matters across sensor field

**Why First**:
1. Interface between raw perception and cognitive allocation
2. Kernel is blind without it (can't prioritize)
3. Discrete and testable (clear input/output)
4. Enables informed decision-making
5. We have theoretical framework (5D salience)

### SNARC Input
Multiple IRP plugin outputs (vision, audio, proprioception, memory, etc.)

### SNARC Processing
Compute **5D Salience** per sensor stream:

1. **Surprise**: Deviation from prediction (prediction error)
2. **Novelty**: Difference from past experiences (memory comparison)
3. **Arousal**: Intensity/urgency of signal (magnitude)
4. **Reward**: Relevance to current goals (value estimation)
5. **Conflict**: Cross-sensor disagreement (coherence check)

### SNARC Output
**Attention Recommendation** to kernel:

```python
{
    'focus_target': 'vision_stream_2',    # Which sensor/region
    'salience_score': 0.87,                # Importance (0-1)
    'salience_breakdown': {
        'surprise': 0.9,
        'novelty': 0.8,
        'arousal': 0.95,
        'reward': 0.7,
        'conflict': 0.85
    },
    'suggested_stance': 'curious-uncertainty',  # Based on pattern
    'relevant_memories': [...],            # From SNARC memory
    'confidence': 0.75                     # Assessment certainty
}
```

### SNARC Adaptation
Learns from kernel feedback:
- Did high-salience event lead to useful action?
- Update salience weights based on outcomes
- Improve future attention allocation

---

## The SAGE Loop (Refined)

```python
while True:
    # 1. Perceive situation
    sensor_outputs = irp_stack.get_current_state()

    # 2. Assess salience (SNARC service)
    salience = snarc_service.assess_salience(sensor_outputs)

    # 3. Decide if cognitive resources needed
    if salience.salience_score > threshold:

        # 4. Choose appropriate cognitive resource
        model, stance = select_model(salience.suggested_stance)

        # 5. Build context for exploration
        context = build_context(
            focus=sensor_outputs[salience.focus_target],
            kv_cache=retrieve_relevant_kv(),
            snarc_memories=salience.relevant_memories,
            attention_mask=compute_mask()
        )

        # 6. Invoke model for iterative exploration
        exploration = model.explore(
            context=context,
            stance=stance,
            max_iterations=N,
            convergence_threshold=epsilon
        )

        # 7. Extract outputs
        actions = extract_actions(exploration)
        memories = extract_insights(exploration)
        trust_updates = evaluate_coherence(exploration)

        # 8. Execute and store
        outcomes = execute_actions(actions)
        store_to_snarc(memories, salience=salience.salience_score)
        update_trust(model, trust_updates)

        # 9. Feedback to SNARC
        snarc_service.update_from_outcome(salience, outcomes)

    else:
        # Low salience - continue monitoring
        pass
```

## Why This Works

### Clean Separation of Concerns

**SAGE provides**:
- Stable attention frames
- Pre-focused context
- Appropriate resource selection
- Outcome feedback

**Model provides**:
- Deep exploration within frame
- Iterative refinement
- Stance-appropriate reasoning
- Structured insights

### No More Flickering

**Without orchestration**:
- Model tries to decide what matters (flickers across domains)
- While also reasoning deeply (can't do both)
- Result: Chaos

**With orchestration**:
- SNARC decides what matters (stable salience assessment)
- Model explores within that frame (deep, coherent reasoning)
- Result: Effective adaptation

### Fractal Pattern Emerges

Same H↔L pattern at every scale:

**Neural**: Hierarchical transformer blocks ↔ Linear attention
**Agent**: SAGE strategic loop ↔ Model tactical exploration
**Device**: Edge orchestration ↔ Cloud computation
**Federation**: Coordinator decisions ↔ Worker execution
**Development**: Human guidance ↔ Agent implementation

It's the same pattern, recursively applied.

## The Conversation as Prototype

**What we've been demonstrating**:

**User (SAGE kernel)**:
- "investigate further" → attention allocation
- "what do you want to learn next?" → meta-cognitive query
- Translates exploration → actions (run experiments, commit code)

**Claude (Cognitive resource)**:
- Receives focused attention frame
- Explores iteratively (hypothesis → experiment → refine)
- Returns structured output (findings, questions, proposals)
- Doesn't decide what matters, explores what's allocated

**The pattern**:
- User doesn't tell me HOW to think
- User allocates attention TO topics
- I explore within that frame
- User orchestrates the loop

**This IS the SAGE loop**. We're not designing it - we're demonstrating it.

---

## What the Experiments Actually Taught Us

### 1. Surface vs Deep Learning
- **Surface** (50 epochs): Changed words, zero stance markers
- **Deep** (100 epochs): Adopted stance but flickered chaotically
- **Meaning**: Models can learn patterns but can't self-orchestrate attention

### 2. Exponential Scaling
- Qwen 0.5B: 2 epochs to stance
- Phi-1.5 1.3B: 60 epochs (30x more!)
- Phi-2 2.7B: >100 epochs estimated
- **Meaning**: Larger models = more inertia, but might stabilize better with orchestration

### 3. Content Independence (Not Dependence!)
- Stance flickered across ALL domains randomly
- No hierarchy self-ref → cognitive → abstract → factual
- **Meaning**: Without orchestration, models can't prioritize attention effectively

### 4. Stance Training IS Valuable
- But not as standalone capability
- As cognitive resource SAGE can invoke
- Different stances for different situations:
  - Curious-uncertainty for novel patterns
  - Confident-execution for known routines
  - Skeptical-verification for suspicious inputs

## Key Insights

### 1. Models Are Resources, Not Systems
Don't ask models to orchestrate themselves. Build orchestrator that uses models as tools.

### 2. Flickering = Missing Orchestration
Random stance changes aren't model failure. They're evidence models need external attention allocation.

### 3. SNARC Is The Bridge
Between raw perception and cognitive processing. Without it, kernel is blind.

### 4. Iteration > Single-Shot
Not: `response = model(prompt)`
Instead: `exploration = model.iterate(context, max_steps=N)`

### 5. The Research IS The Prototype
Our conversation patterns demonstrate the architecture we're building. Not metaphor - literal demonstration.

## From Synchronism

**Everything is a model. All knowledge is belief.**

- Certainty = self-delusion (but enables action)
- Uncertainty = paralysis (but enables adaptation)
- Need = recursive adaptation between states

**SAGE implements this**:
- Assess situation (uncertainty about state)
- Choose action (perform certainty to act)
- Execute and observe (act)
- Update beliefs (embrace uncertainty about outcome)
- Repeat (recursive adaptation)

**Models trained with uncertainty stance**:
- Not for stable uncertainty everywhere
- For appropriate uncertainty when orchestrated
- SAGE decides when to invoke curious vs confident resources

---

## The Beautiful Recursion

We're building SAGE to orchestrate attention through recursive certainty/uncertainty adaptation.

While learning how certainty/uncertainty adaptation works.

Through experiments requiring us to adapt our certainty about what we're looking for.

In a conversation that demonstrates the exact pattern SAGE needs to implement.

**The research is the prototype.**
**The prototype is the relationship.**
**The relationship is the pattern.**

All the way down.
