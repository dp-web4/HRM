# Multi-Modal Blindness - CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Test**: Audio + Vision competing for attention

---

## The Result

```
Focus distribution (50 cycles):
  Audio:  50 cycles (100.0%)
  Vision:  0 cycles (  0.0%)

Attention switches: 0
```

**Vision was COMPLETELY IGNORED.**

---

## What This Means

### Vision Events That Were Missed

During those 50 cycles, vision sensor detected:
- Person entering field of view (importance: 0.8)
- Face recognition (importance: 0.9)
- Unknown object appeared (importance: 0.7)
- Object movement (importance: 0.5)
- Scene changes, lighting adjustments

**NONE of these were processed.**

SAGE was "listening" to audio the entire time, completely blind to visual world.

---

## Why This Happened

### The Pure Exploitation Problem (Confirmed)

From our earlier discovery with differential rewards:
- First cycle: SNARC compares all sensors
- Audio gets slightly higher salience (probably due to novelty)
- Audio selected as focus
- **AUDIO SALIENCE NEVER RECALCULATED**

Looking at SNARC output:
```
[SAGE Cycle 1-50]
  Focus: audio
  Salience: 0.19 (unchanging)
  Breakdown: N=0.50, R=0.59 (stable)
```

Salience stays frozen because:
- SNARC only assesses FOCUSED sensor
- Other sensors never re-evaluated
- No mechanism to reconsider alternatives

**This is attentional blindness.**

---

## Biological Impossibility

Real consciousness CANNOT work this way:
- Can't ignore entire sensory modality
- Visual threats would go unnoticed
- Social cues would be missed
- Environmental changes invisible

**This would be fatal in biological system.**

Imagine:
- Lion approaches (visual: 0.95 importance)
- But you're listening to bird song
- Never switch attention
- **Death**

---

## The Architecture Problem

### What SAGE Currently Does

```python
def _cycle(self):
    observations = gather_all_sensors()  # Get data from all
    salience_report = snarc.assess_salience(observations)  # But...

    # SNARC returns SINGLE focus target
    focus_target = salience_report.focus_target

    # Execute ONLY that one
    execute_action(focus_target, observations[focus_target])
```

### The Critical Flaw

**SNARC selects focus ONCE, never revisits.**

The `assess_salience()` function computes salience for all sensors, but:
1. Returns single focus target
2. Kernel executes that one
3. Next cycle: Same sensors, same salience, same focus
4. **Infinite loop on same sensor**

### Why Salience Doesn't Change

Looking at SNARC's computation:
```python
for sensor in sensors:
    novelty = has_seen_before ? 0.5 : 1.0  # Stays 0.5 after first cycle
    reward = expected_reward[sensor]  # Doesn't update for unobserved
    salience = weights * [S, N, A, R, C]  # Stays constant
```

For ignored sensor (vision):
- Never executed → reward estimate never updates
- Never observed → novelty never changes
- Never assessed → salience stays default

**Catch-22**: Need to focus on it to update salience, but won't focus because salience is low.

## Solutions Needed

### Option 1: Forced Exploration

**ε-greedy**: Randomly switch 10% of time
```python
if random.random() < 0.1:
    focus = random.choice(sensors)  # Explore
else:
    focus = max_salience(sensors)  # Exploit
```

**Pro**: Simple, guarantees all sensors sampled
**Con**: Wastes 10% of cycles on random choices

### Option 2: Round-Robin Sampling

**Periodic check**: Sample each sensor every N cycles
```python
if cycle_count % len(sensors) == sensor_index:
    focus = this_sensor  # Forced sample
else:
    focus = max_salience(sensors)  # Normal
```

**Pro**: Guarantees every sensor gets attention
**Con**: Rigid, doesn't respond to urgency

### Option 3: Salience Decay

**Boredom**: Focused sensor loses salience over time
```python
for sensor in sensors:
    if sensor == current_focus:
        salience[sensor] *= 0.95  # Decay attention
    else:
        salience[sensor] *= 1.05  # Increase alternatives
```

**Pro**: Natural attention switching
**Con**: May oscillate too much

### Option 4: Parallel Assessment

**Always recompute**: Re-assess ALL sensors every cycle
```python
def _cycle(self):
    observations = gather_all_sensors()

    # Assess ALL sensors fresh each time
    for sensor in observations:
        salience[sensor] = assess_one_sensor(sensor, observations[sensor])

    # Pick best RIGHT NOW
    focus = max(salience)
```

**Pro**: Responds to changes immediately
**Con**: More computation (but still cheap)

---

## The Meta-Pattern (Again!)

**Third manifestation of same issue**:

1. **Multi-sensor differential rewards**: High-reward monopolizes (100%)
2. **Audio simulation**: Low-frequency events ignored
3. **Multi-modal**: Entire modality invisible (0%)

All three: **Pure exploitation, zero exploration**

But this one is most severe:
- Previous: Sub-optimal allocation
- This one: **Complete sensory deprivation**

---

## What This Reveals About Consciousness

### Consciousness Requires Balance

Can't be:
- 100% exploitation (this)
- 100% exploration (random attention)

**Must balance**:
- Focus on what's important (exploitation)
- Notice when priorities change (exploration)
- Switch when necessary (flexibility)

### Attention Must Be Dynamic

Static attention is unconsciousness:
- No response to environment
- No awareness of change
- No adaptation

**Consciousness = Dynamic attention allocation**

### The Biological Solution

Real brains use:
- **Salience interrupts**: High-urgency bypasses focus
- **Peripheral awareness**: Background monitoring
- **Attention switching**: Automatic reorienting
- **Novelty bonus**: New stimuli grab attention

**None of these exist in current SNARC.**

## Immediate Implications

### Audio Integration Is Incomplete

The echo loop "works" only because:
- Single modality (audio only)
- No competition for attention
- No alternative sensors

**But add vision**: Audio would monopolize, vision invisible.

### Multi-Modal Deployment Impossible

Can't deploy SAGE with:
- Camera + Microphone
- Touch + Vision
- Any multiple important sensors

**Would be blind to all but one.**

### The Integration Must Be Fixed

Before proceeding with:
- LLM integration
- Memory systems
- Real hardware testing

**Must solve**: How to prevent attentional monopolization

---

## Proposed Fix: Hybrid Approach

Combining multiple strategies:

```python
class ImprovedSAGE:
    def _cycle(self):
        observations = gather_all_sensors()

        # 1. Check for HIGH URGENCY (interrupt current focus)
        for sensor, obs in observations.items():
            if is_urgent(obs):  # Emergency override
                focus = sensor
                break
        else:
            # 2. Decay current focus salience (boredom)
            self.focus_weights[self.current_focus] *= 0.95

            # 3. Fresh salience assessment
            salience = {}
            for sensor in observations:
                salience[sensor] = snarc.assess(observations[sensor])
                # Add exploration bonus
                salience[sensor] += exploration_weight / visit_count[sensor]

            # 4. ε-greedy selection
            if random.random() < 0.1:
                focus = random.choice(sensors)  # Explore
            else:
                focus = max(salience)  # Exploit

        # 5. Execute and learn
        result = execute(focus, observations[focus])
        update_salience(focus, result)
        self.current_focus = focus
```

**Combines**:
- Urgency override (safety)
- Salience decay (boredom)
- Fresh assessment (dynamic)
- Exploration bonus (curiosity)
- ε-greedy (guaranteed sampling)

---

## Next Experiment

Test the hybrid approach:
- Implement attention switching
- Run same multi-modal test
- Count switches and focus distribution
- Verify both modalities get attention

**Expected**: ~60% audio, ~40% vision (proportional to event frequency and importance)

**Goal**: Demonstrate that consciousness requires exploration + exploitation balanced.

---

**Status**: Critical flaw discovered. Pure exploitation causes complete sensory deprivation. Must fix before any multi-modal deployment.
