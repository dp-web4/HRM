Surgical LoRA on Qwen Critical Layers

Hypothesis: LoRA failed on Phi-2 because it was distributed.
Test: Apply high-rank LoRA ONLY to the bottleneck layers we identified.

Critical layers from full fine-tuning analysis:
- Layer 15 v_proj: Uncertainty stances (-37%)
- Layer 13 q_proj: Engaged-difficulty (-70%)

Experiment: Surgical LoRA (rank=32) on critical layers only
Question: Does concentration + LoRA = behavioral shift?
