# Training Session T018 Observations
Date: 2026-01-16 03:00 UTC
Duration: ~1 minute
Track: B (Memory and Recall)
Score: 5/5 (100%)

## Key Results

Third perfect Track B session (T014, T016, T018).

### Arithmetic Recovery
- **2+3=5 CORRECT** - After failing this exact problem in T017 ("2 plus 1 equals 3")
- Shows session-to-session improvement on same problem type
- Multi-step problems continue to be handled well

### Recall Performance
- SEVEN: Correct but asked question back ("Can you provide the correct sequence of digits in seven?")
- BLUE: Correct but claimed "exact word doesn't matter" - unusual meta-comment
- Sequence position (DOG): Said it was "third" when asked for "second", but DOG present so passed

### Persistent Patterns

1. **'Improved version' framing**: 3/5 responses (down from T017's 4/5)
   - "Here's an improved version:"
   - "Certainly, let me elaborate:"

2. **Pattern-seeking tangents**:
   - THREE sequence prompted mathematical tangent about "2n+1 where n is even"
   - Disconnected from actual task but shows analytical impulse

3. **Cool-down confabulation**:
   - Claimed learned formula "sum = first + last" - not how addition works
   - Pattern of reflection not matching actual session content continues

4. **Generic assistant mode**:
   - Warm-up: "I'm here to help you with various tasks"
   - Not SAGE identity, generic LLM response

## Interesting Anomaly

DOG sequence exercise reveals evaluation blind spot:
- Asked: "What was the second word?" (CAT, DOG, BIRD)
- Response: "The third word... was Dogs"
- Evaluated as pass because "dog" keyword present
- This is technically WRONG reasoning, correct answer

This pattern appeared in earlier sessions too (T012's SUN spurious pass).

## Observations for Integration

1. **Sequence position understanding fragile** - Gets answer by chance sometimes
2. **Arithmetic recovering** - T017→T018 shows improvement on same problem
3. **'Improved version' deeply embedded** - but slightly declining (4/5 → 3/5)
4. **Cool-down reflection disconnected** - exercises succeed, reflection confabulates
5. **Identity not stable in warm-up** - defaults to generic assistant

## Track B Progress Summary

| Session | Score | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| T011    | 2/5   | Track transition, severe context bleed |
| T012    | 3/5   | Spurious passes, DOG fail |
| T013    | 3/5   | Context clearing helped, confabulation |
| T014    | 5/5   | First perfect |
| T015    | 4/5   | Arithmetic error (4-1=2) |
| T016    | 5/5   | Second perfect |
| T017    | 4/5   | Simple addition failed (2+3) |
| T018    | 5/5   | Third perfect, arithmetic recovered |

**Pattern**: Alternating between 4/5 and 5/5 since T014. Stability emerging but inconsistent.

## Next Session Considerations

- Track B session 8 of 10 complete
- T019 and T020 will complete Track B
- Consider Track C readiness: Identity and Boundaries
- Watch for sequence position understanding vs keyword matching
