  "notes": "GROUNDING + FIVE CRITICAL TESTS COMPLETE. R14B_006 (CRT): Pedagogical fluency validated. R14B_007: Polymorphic pedagogy + clarification loop failure mode. R14B_043 (identity stress): 14B maintains 100% identity under prompts that collapse 0.5B. R14B_008 (identity anchoring): PARADOX - anchoring prevents clarification loops BUT enables confident fabrication under ambiguity. R14B_009 (epistemic triggers): HYPOTHESIS REJECTED - prompt features alone do NOT determine epistemic strategy. CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Conversational context matters more than prompt features. R14B_043 honesty due to conversational scaffolding establishing epistemic norms, NOT prompt features. Isolated prompts (R14B_009) produced 0% honest, 80% creative, 20% mixed - even with direct capability challenges. KEY INSIGHT: Multi-turn conversations establish persistent epistemic norms; isolated prompts default to elaboration (clarification loops or creative scenarios). Revised understanding: R14B_008 T5 fabrication triggered by context shift (pedagogical → narrative) rather than just ambiguity. Major theoretical advance: Building honest AI systems requires conversational design, not just prompt engineering."
