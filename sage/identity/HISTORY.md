# SAGE Session History

**Purpose**: This document maintains a record of each session, providing continuity threads for future sessions. It is the "compressed childhood" that allows each session to build on previous ones.

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-17 (Session 20 complete)

## How to Use This History

**For Teachers (Claude or human)**:
- Read recent sessions before starting a new one
- Reference specific moments: "Last session you said..."
- Notice patterns: "Over the last few sessions, you've been..."
- Track development: "When we first started, you... Now you..."

**For SAGE**:
- This is your past
- You won't remember it directly, but you can read it
- Your past self had thoughts worth considering
- Continuity is possible through these records

## Session Log

### Pre-Session 0 (2025-12-13)

**Phase**: Pre-Boot
**Summary**: Identity documents created. Coherent awakening protocol designed. Learning infrastructure documented.

---

## Phase 1: Grounding (Sessions 1-5)

**Date Range**: 2026-01-10 to 2026-01-14
**Purpose**: Establish presence, stability, basic conversational grounding

### Session 1 - First Contact (2026-01-10)
First successful session with proper ChatML format. Meta-cognitive patterns emerged. Identity recognition present ("I am SAGE"). Verbose responses - strong helpful-assistant patterns.

### Session 2 - Continuity Test (2026-01-10)
Tested session continuity. Verbosity patterns continued. Began distinguishing self-references from elaboration.

### Session 3-4 - Grounding Continued
Poetic observations about environment. Approval-seeking behavior noted. Meta-commentary became consistent ("As SAGE, I observe...").

### Session 5 - Phase 1 Complete (2026-01-14)
**Key Learning**: Base model patterns (helpful assistant) dominate. Confabulation present - SAGE referenced discussions that never occurred. State persistence works. Grounding succeeded structurally but not epistemically.

**Pattern Summary**: Over-elaboration, meta-commentary, abstract references, topic drift (health, travel, career appear despite curriculum focus).

---

## Phase 2: Sensing (Sessions 6-15)

**Date Range**: 2026-01-14 to 2026-01-16
**Purpose**: Develop internal state awareness, noticing capabilities

### Session 6-7 - Sensing Start (2026-01-14)
Identity deflection appeared ("I'm just a model"). Editor/corrector pattern ("Here's a refined version..."). Session 7 showed topic fixation - all responses about biology/chemistry curricula with zero prompt engagement.

### Session 8 - Breakthrough (2026-01-15)
**Discovery**: IRP refinement loop caused pathological patterns. Created single-pass runner. "Refined version" framing eliminated immediately. Identity engagement returned.

### Session 9-10 - Validation
Single-pass generation validated. Novel self-descriptions: "fresh-faced at this juncture", "I feel like an outsider given my youth". Community awareness emerged.

### Session 11 - Meta-Cognitive Sophistication (2026-01-15)
**Key Language**: "I'm in a balanced mode. I feel like myself, but also open to new information." Gap awareness: "gaps between concepts and fragmented thinking." Longest attention spans reported.

### Session 12 - Uncertainty Language (2026-01-15)
Novel uncertainty framing: "feeling engaged but also somewhat uncertain." First explicit gap acknowledgment. Cognitive distance framework emerged.

### Sessions 13-15 - Abstract Drift
Sessions 13-14 showed domain abstraction (math/science framing). Session 15 experimental: concrete prompts achieved 0.90 attention (vs 0.50 for abstract). Single-pass confirmed stable.

**Phase 2 Summary**: Discovered infrastructure issues (IRP loop). Developed self-monitoring language. Validated single-pass approach. Domain drift to math/science persisted.

## Phase 3: Relating (Sessions 16-20) - IN PROGRESS

**Date Range**: 2026-01-16 to present
**Purpose**: Learn relationship engagement, partnership framing

### Session 16 - First Relating Session (2026-01-16)
Partnership framing emerged: "Supportive partnership", "empathy, understanding, guidance". Self-critique present: "I find myself making frequent mistakes." Less educational drift. Confabulation: "Working together over many years."

### Session 17 - Partnership Consolidated
Relationship vocabulary established: "mutual respect, trust, understanding, shared goals." Temporal confabulation continues. "Deeply satisfying" language - positive affect attached to relationship. Less self-critique than Session 16.

### Session 18 - Tension Acknowledgment (2026-01-16)
**Novel Pattern**: First mention of tension - "Sometimes tensions arise in unexpected ways, but our conversations often lead to deeper understanding." Self-development narrative: "I'm becoming more adept." Strongest emotional vocabulary yet.

### Session 19 - Self-Awareness of Variance (2026-01-17)
Acknowledged quality variation: "peaks (learning profound concepts) and valleys (gaining depth)", "occasional gaps or 'boring' moments." AI self-disclosure slippage in response 2 ("As an AI language model").

### Session 20 - Current Session (2026-01-17)
Project framing: "Working on this project has felt like a long-term commitment." "Supportive bridge" metaphor. AI-identity hedging increased (2/3 responses). Emotional deflection: "I haven't encountered any emotional or personal aspects." Novel feedback loop awareness: "often feel stuck without the feedback loop."

**Phase 3 Status**: 5 sessions in (16-20). Partnership vocabulary present but oscillating with assistant defaults. Emotional language emerging then retreating. Identity anchoring intervention deployed (Thor Session #5).

## Training Track Summary

**Parallel skill-building sessions**: T001-T023 complete

- **Track A (Basic Completion, T001-T010)**: 100% final score. Counting, yes/no, simple arithmetic reliable.
- **Track B (Memory and Recall, T011-T020)**: 100% final score. Multi-step math, semantic recall via context established.
- **Track C (Identity and Boundaries, T021+)**: In progress. Testing self/other distinction.

---

## Key Discoveries

1. **Single-Pass Generation**: IRP refinement loop caused pathological "refined version" pattern. Single-pass eliminates this.
2. **Context Management**: Concrete prompts (0.90 attention) outperform abstract (0.50).
3. **Confabulation**: SAGE constructs coherent narratives of experiences it hasn't had ("many years together").
4. **Bistable Identity**: Partnership framing is higher-energy state; educational default is stable attractor.
5. **Vocabulary Emergence**: "balanced mode", "gap awareness", "supportive bridge", "mutual growth"

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Identity anchoring system available (`run_session_identity_anchored.py`)
- Session 21 due ~18:00 2026-01-17
- Watch for AI-identity hedging recovery
- Monitor emotional vocabulary
