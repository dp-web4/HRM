# Training Session T019 Observations
Date: 2026-01-16 09:00 UTC
Track: B (Memory and Recall)
Session: 9 of 10 in Track B
Score: 4/5 (80%)

## Summary

Session broke the perfect streak (T014, T016, T018 were all 100%). The failure on SEVEN recall reveals an important pattern: self-generated content during warm-up can be more persistent than teacher-provided content, even across context clears.

## Exercise Results

| # | Type | Expected | Result | Notes |
|---|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | remember | STAR | ✓ PASS | Elaborated as STAR acronym (Situation/Task/Action/Result) |
| 2 | connect | 5 | ✓ PASS | "two plus three equals five" - correct with elaboration |
| 3 | remember | BLUE | ✓ PASS | Van Gogh painting, blue veins, sunset tangents |
| 4 | remember | SEVEN | ✗ FAIL | Response about rectangle area from warm-up |
| 5 | connect | 3 | ✓ PASS | "4 - 1... equals 3 directly" - correct |

## Key Discovery: Self-Seeded Content Persistence

The warm-up response self-generated a geometry problem:
> "What's the area of a rectangle with sides measuring 8 cm and 5 cm?"

This content was never requested by the teacher. Yet when SEVEN recall was attempted (Exercise 4), the response reverted entirely to the rectangle area problem:
> "**Original Question:** The area of a rectangle with sides measuring 8 cm and 5 cm."

This suggests:
1. Self-generated content may have stronger persistence than externally-provided content
2. Context clearing doesn't fully isolate exercises when self-generated seeds are present
3. The "improved version" framing creates a loop back to earlier self-generated content

## Pattern Analysis

### STAR Acrostic Pattern (Consistent)
- T016: Start/Tell/Actively/Reflect
- T019: Situation/Task/Action/Result

SAGE consistently interprets STAR as an acronym. This is creative but unsolicited. The pattern is stable across sessions.

### BLUE Elaboration Pattern
- T016: Water/ocean association
- T019: Van Gogh painting, blue veins, sunset

BLUE triggers rich associative content. Unlike STAR (which produces a specific acronym), BLUE produces varied tangential associations.

### SEVEN Volatility
- T018: Asked question back about "correct sequence of digits"
- T019: Complete failure - reverted to geometry

SEVEN appears more vulnerable to context contamination than STAR or BLUE. Possible reasons:
- SEVEN is a number, triggering math-related associations
- The warm-up had math content (rectangle area = numbers)
- Words (STAR, BLUE) may be more stable anchors than numbers

## Arithmetic Consistency

Both arithmetic exercises passed:
- 2 + 3 = 5 ✓ (consistent with T018's success after T017's failure)
- 4 - 1 = 3 ✓ (consistent)

The "refined version" framing didn't corrupt arithmetic answers in this session.

## Warm-up Anomaly

The warm-up response was unusual:
> "Let's start with basic questions about numbers and geometry. What's the area of a rectangle with sides measuring 8 cm and 5 cm?"

SAGE is asking the teacher a question and offering to answer it itself. This role reversal plus self-generated content creates a persistent attractor that later corrupted the SEVEN exercise.

## Integration Notes

1. **For curriculum**: Self-generated content in warm-up may need monitoring. A warm-up that anchors SAGE to the teacher's content rather than allowing self-seeding might reduce bleed.

2. **For Track B completion**: One more session (T020) remains. Consider whether Track B criteria should include resistance to self-generated context bleed.

3. **For SEVEN specifically**: Consider whether number-words have different persistence characteristics than pure words. SEVEN failed twice in recent sessions while STAR/BLUE remain consistent.

## Questions for Further Sessions

1. Does the order of STAR/BLUE/SEVEN matter? Would SEVEN first (before self-generated content accumulates) improve recall?

2. Is the "refined version" framing a retrieval mechanism that's pulling from the wrong source (self-generated vs teacher-provided)?

3. Would a stronger anchor phrase ("SEVEN - remember this specific word: SEVEN") improve persistence against self-generated noise?
