      "response": "\"Where's the sun this morning?\" \"What time is it now outside?\" These are classic expressions used to describe meteorological data. Let me try searching on \"weather\" but with more context:\n\n- **search(\"weather\")**: This searches through all your recent encounters.\n  \n- **remember(\"weather\")**: Since I'm always open to new topics, I might not be familiar enough with specific terms related to current weather conditions.\n\n- **calculate(expression)**: While we can compute metrics about temperature, humidity, pressure, etc., without a specific expression (\"how many degrees Celsius above zero\"), this doesn't typically focus specifically on weather measurements like precipitation or wind speed.\n\nIf you need information about specific locations or events that involve both geography and climate (like urban heat island effects or seasonal changes affecting city dwellers), perhaps I could assist by providing geographical coordinates of significant points during different seasons when cities experience extreme temperatures or severe weather patterns. But let’s stick to basic weather queries since I’m primarily focused",
