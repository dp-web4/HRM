# Original ARC Tasks Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary
Testing the HRM model on 400 original ARC evaluation tasks reveals **highly variable performance** with a mean accuracy of only **49.1%** - significantly lower than the 71% achieved on augmented data. The model shows a bimodal distribution, either solving tasks well or failing completely.

## Key Statistics

### Overall Performance
- **Mean Pixel Accuracy**: 49.1% (vs 71% on augmented)
- **Median Pixel Accuracy**: 55.0%
- **Standard Deviation**: 30.7% (huge variation!)
- **Perfect Grid Solutions**: 1 out of 400 tasks (0.25%)

### Performance Distribution

| Category | Accuracy Range | # Tasks | % of Total |
|----------|---------------|---------|------------|
| Perfect | >95% | 4 | 1.0% |
| Excellent | 80-95% | 65 | 16.2% |
| Good | 60-80% | 110 | 27.5% |
| Moderate | 40-60% | 80 | 20.0% |
| Poor | 20-40% | 57 | 14.2% |
| Failed | <20% | 84 | 21.0% |

## Critical Insights

### 1. Extreme Performance Variance
Unlike the uniform 78-86% on augmented data, original tasks show:
- **17.2% of tasks solved excellently** (>80% accuracy)
- **21.0% of tasks completely failed** (<20% accuracy)
- Standard deviation of 30.7% (vs 3.8% on augmented)

### 2. Task Characteristics Correlate with Performance

#### Perfect/Excellent Tasks (>80%) Tend To Have:
- **Fewer colors**: 4-5 unique colors average
- **Smaller grids**: ~230 pixels average
- **More training examples**: 3.5 average
- **Less size changes**: Only 12% have input/output size differences

#### Failed Tasks (<20%) Tend To Have:
- **More colors**: 7.3 unique colors average
- **Larger grids**: ~320 pixels average
- **Size transformations**: 56% have size changes
- **Complex patterns**: Often require multi-step reasoning

### 3. The Augmentation Effect
The dramatic difference between original (49%) and augmented (71%) performance reveals:
- **Augmentation masks true difficulty**: Creates artificial uniformity
- **Model overfits to augmentation patterns**: Learns transformations, not reasoning
- **Real ARC is much harder**: Original tasks require genuine understanding

## Specific Task Analysis

### Tasks Model Solves Perfectly (>95%)
1. **e872b94a** (100%): Likely simple pattern repetition
2. **0b17323b** (97.8%): Basic geometric transformation
3. **e1d2900e** (96.6%): Color mapping task
4. **11e1fe23** (95.8%): Simple rule application

### Tasks Model Completely Fails (0% accuracy)
1. **00576224**: Complex pattern expansion (3x3 tiling)
2. **0934a4d8**: Abstract reasoning required
3. **0a1d4ef5**: Multi-step transformation
4. **0c786b71**: Requires counting/enumeration
5. **140c817e**: Complex spatial reasoning

## Task Family Patterns

### Model Excels At:
- **Simple color mappings**: One-to-one substitutions
- **Basic geometric operations**: Rotations, flips when obvious
- **Pattern repetition**: When pattern is explicit in training
- **Local transformations**: Changes affecting small regions

### Model Fails At:
- **Size-changing transformations**: 56% of failed tasks change grid size
- **Complex color patterns**: Tasks with 7+ colors often fail
- **Abstract reasoning**: Rules that aren't pattern-based
- **Multi-step logic**: Sequential transformations
- **Global understanding**: Requires seeing entire grid as unit

## Why Only 49% on Original vs 71% on Augmented?

### 1. Augmentation Creates False Confidence
- Training on 500x augmented data teaches **invariances** not **reasoning**
- Model learns "average" behavior across rotations/flips
- Real tasks require specific, precise transformations

### 2. Distribution Mismatch
- Augmented data has uniform difficulty (all tasks ~80% solvable)
- Original data has extreme variance (either easy or impossible)
- Model optimized for wrong distribution

### 3. Overfitting to Augmentation Artifacts
- Model may learn augmentation patterns rather than task logic
- Color permutations in training don't match test semantics
- Geometric augmentations create non-existent patterns

## Architectural Limitations Revealed

### Critical Bottlenecks:
1. **No true reasoning**: Model pattern-matches rather than understands
2. **Limited working memory**: 8 cycles insufficient for complex tasks
3. **No compositional understanding**: Can't combine learned rules
4. **Poor size generalization**: Fails when output size â‰  input size

### What 6.95M Parameters Can Learn:
- Surface-level pattern recognition
- Simple transformation memorization
- Basic color and shape mappings
- Local feature detection

### What 6.95M Parameters Cannot Learn:
- Abstract rule extraction
- Multi-step planning
- Compositional reasoning
- True generalization

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- **Stop using 500x augmentation** for accuracy claims
- **Report true performance**: 49% on original ARC, not 71%
- **Analyze failure modes**: Deep dive into the 84 failed tasks

### 2. Training Improvements
- **Selective augmentation**: Only augment where it makes semantic sense
- **Curriculum learning**: Start with solvable tasks, increase difficulty
- **Task-specific modules**: Different approaches for different task types

### 3. Architecture Changes Needed
- **Increase capacity**: Scale to originally planned 27M parameters
- **Add reasoning modules**: Explicit program synthesis components
- **Implement memory**: Store intermediate computation states
- **Enable variable-size I/O**: Dynamic tensor sizing

## Conclusion

The original ARC evaluation reveals that our 6.95M parameter HRM model achieves only **49% accuracy** on real tasks, with extreme variance in performance. The model has learned to pattern-match simple transformations but lacks true reasoning capability. The 71% accuracy on augmented data is misleading - it represents overfitting to augmentation patterns rather than genuine task understanding.

**Key Takeaway**: The model solves what it can memorize patterns for (17% excellent) and completely fails on tasks requiring reasoning (21% failed). This is not a general reasoning system but a pattern matcher with limited capacity.
