# Phase 2 Results - Algorithmic Per-Sensor SNARC

**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Achievement**: Rebuilt SNARC from first principles to match conceptual vision

---

## What We Built

A complete algorithmic per-sensor SNARC implementation that:
- **Zero learned parameters** - works immediately, no training
- **Per-sensor instances** - each sensor has own SNARC with own memory
- **Spatial structure** - SpatialSNARC preserves "where" information for vision
- **Hierarchical integration** - cross-modal conflict computation
- **Production-ready** - all tests passing, integrated with SAGE loop

---

## The Problem (From Phase 1)

User asked to examine SNARC and evaluate whether it fits SAGE's objectives:

*"the whole snarc thing came from the 'transformer-sidecar..' repo that we grabbed as useful open source. i think the fundamental concepts are absolutely valid and valuable. this would be a good time to examine the details of it and whether and how they fit into our objectives/architecture. we take nothing as 'given', it is useful to the extent it is."*

**Critical Analysis Revealed**:

### Conceptual Vision (from `/forum/nova/concepts/SAGE-SNARC.md`)
- SNARC as universal salience filter for ALL sensors/effectors
- Per-sensor SNARC instances with spatial/temporal grids
- Hierarchical integration (local → global)
- Fractal tiling of salience

### Original Implementation (from `/sage/attention/snarc_scorer.py`)
- PyTorch learned neural networks (~100K+ parameters)
- Single global scorer (not per-sensor)
- Operates on hidden states (not raw sensors)
- No spatial structure

**Gap Identified**: Concept excellent, implementation misaligned.

**Decision**: Rebuild to match vision.

---

## What We Implemented

### 1. SensorSNARC - Base Algorithmic Scorer

**File**: `/sage/attention/sensor_snarc.py`

**Core Class**:
```python
class SensorSNARC:
    """Algorithmic SNARC for specific sensor - no learning"""

    def __init__(self, sensor_name, memory_size=1000, device=None):
        self.sensor_name = sensor_name
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=memory_size)  # Per-sensor memory
        self.predictor = SimplePredictor()
        # Zero learned parameters!

    def score(self, observation, context=None) -> SNARCScores:
        """Compute 5D scores algorithmically"""
        surprise = self._compute_surprise(observation)    # Prediction error
        novelty = self._compute_novelty(observation)      # Distance from memory
        arousal = self._compute_arousal(observation)      # Signal variance
        conflict = 0.0  # Computed at fusion level
        reward = context.get('reward', 0.0)

        return SNARCScores(...)
```

**The 5 Algorithmic Dimensions**:

1. **Surprise** - Prediction error from simple AR model
   - Compares observation to predicted from recent history
   - High MSE = high surprise
   - No learned predictor, just moving average

2. **Novelty** - Distance from observation memory
   - Cosine distance to all past observations
   - Minimum distance = novelty score
   - Per-sensor memory bank

3. **Arousal** - Signal intensity/variance
   - Standard deviation of observation
   - High variance = high arousal
   - Direct computation from signal

4. **Conflict** - Cross-source disagreement
   - Not computed at sensor level
   - Computed by HierarchicalSNARC at fusion
   - Requires multiple sensors

5. **Reward** - External signal
   - Provided by environment/context
   - Explicit importance marker

### 2. SpatialSNARC - Vision with Spatial Grids

**Extension**: Inherits from SensorSNARC, adds spatial structure

```python
class SpatialSNARC(SensorSNARC):
    def score_grid(self, image, context=None) -> (torch.Tensor, SNARCScores):
        """
        Compute SNARC heatmap overlaying image

        Returns:
            snarc_map: [5, H, W] tensor with SNARC dimensions
            global_scores: Averaged global scores
        """
        # Spatial surprise: edge detection (Sobel gradients)
        snarc_map[0] = compute_spatial_gradients(image)

        # Spatial arousal: local variance
        snarc_map[2] = compute_local_variance(image)

        return snarc_map, global_scores
```

**Result**: Visual attention heatmaps showing where to look.

### 3. HierarchicalSNARC - Cross-Modal Integration

**Purpose**: Compute cross-modal conflict and unified salience

```python
class HierarchicalSNARC:
    def __init__(self, device=None):
        self.sensor_snarcs = {}  # Per-sensor SNARC instances

    def register_sensor(self, sensor_name, snarc):
        """Register per-sensor SNARC"""
        self.sensor_snarcs[sensor_name] = snarc

    def score_all(self, observations, context=None):
        """Score all sensors and compute cross-modal conflict"""
        # Level 1: Per-sensor scores
        sensor_scores = {
            name: snarc.score(obs, context)
            for name, obs in observations.items()
        }

        # Level 3: Cross-modal conflict
        conflict = self._compute_cross_modal_conflict(sensor_scores)

        # Update conflict in all sensors
        for scores in sensor_scores.values():
            scores.conflict = conflict

        return sensor_scores
```

**Cross-Modal Conflict**:
- Variance across sensor salience scores
- High conflict when sensors disagree
- Example: Vision urgent (0.9) but audio calm (0.2) → investigate!

## What This Means for SAGE

### Immediate Benefits

1. **No Training Phase** - SNARC works out of the box
   - No need to collect training data
   - No optimization required
   - Immediate deployment

2. **Per-Sensor Salience** - Modality-aware attention
   - Vision SNARC knows visual patterns
   - Audio SNARC knows acoustic patterns
   - Different baselines, different memories

3. **Spatial Attention** - Know where to look
   - SNARC heatmaps overlay visual field
   - Edge detection highlights salient regions
   - Local variance captures complexity

4. **Cross-Modal Conflict** - Detect disagreement
   - Vision urgent but audio calm → investigate
   - Audio alert but vision normal → verify
   - Sensor fusion with disagreement detection

5. **Interpretable Salience** - Understand decisions
   - Know why something is salient
   - Surprise: unexpected
   - Novelty: never seen before
   - Arousal: intense/complex
   - Conflict: sensors disagree
   - Reward: externally important

### SAGE Orchestration Enhanced

**Before** (Phase 1):
```python
# Single salience score, unclear why
salience = 0.5
```

**After** (Phase 2):
```python
# Rich 5D salience with explanations
scores = snarc.score(observation)
# scores.surprise = 0.8  # Unexpected pattern
# scores.novelty = 0.3   # Seen similar before
# scores.arousal = 0.9   # High complexity
# scores.conflict = 0.1  # Sensors agree
# scores.reward = 0.0    # Not explicitly important
# scores.combined = 0.62 # Overall salience

# SAGE can now decide:
if scores.surprise > 0.7 and scores.novelty < 0.5:
    # Unexpected but familiar pattern → investigate quickly
    allocate_resources('vision', priority='high')
elif scores.conflict > 0.6:
    # Sensors disagree → cross-validate
    allocate_resources(['vision', 'audio'], priority='urgent')
```

## Alignment with Philosophy

**User's Challenge**: *"we take nothing as 'given', it is useful to the extent it is."*

**What We Did**:
1. ✅ Examined SNARC critically (SNARC_ANALYSIS.md)
2. ✅ Found gap between concept and implementation
3. ✅ Rebuilt from first principles
4. ✅ Validated through tests
5. ✅ Integrated with SAGE
6. ✅ Documented thoroughly

**The Learning Process**:
- Original SNARC (Transformer-Sidecar): Hebbian fast-weights for memory
- Conceptual extension (SAGE-SNARC.md): Universal salience filter
- Implementation gap: Learned networks didn't match vision
- Solution: Algorithmic computation matching biological parallels

**R&D Mindset**: *"there are no mistakes, only lessons"*

The learned SNARC wasn't wrong - it taught us what we actually needed. Now we have it.

---

## Biological Parallels

### What Biology Does

1. **Early Sensory** - V1 computes edges, motion, color (algorithmic)
2. **Hippocampus** - Compares input to memory (novelty detection)
3. **Predictive Coding** - Brain predicts, errors propagate (surprise)
4. **Parietal Cortex** - Cross-modal integration (conflict detection)
5. **Thalamus** - Gates sensory streams by salience (attention allocation)

### What SAGE Does Now

1. **SpatialSNARC** - Computes spatial gradients (edges), local variance
2. **Per-Sensor Memory** - Compares to past observations (novelty)
3. **Simple Predictor** - Expected vs actual (surprise)
4. **HierarchicalSNARC** - Cross-modal variance (conflict)
5. **Combined Salience** - ATP budget allocation (attention)

**Not mimicking - discovering same optimal solutions.**

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3)
1. **Replace old SNARC** in existing code with algorithmic version
2. **Real sensor integration** - Wire camera to SpatialSNARC
3. **Visualize salience** - Heatmaps showing where SAGE attends
4. **Multi-sensor testing** - Add audio, test cross-modal conflict

### Short-term
1. **Temporal SNARC for audio** - 1D bins over time (where in sound?)
2. **Motor SNARC for effectors** - Which actuators need attention?
3. **VisionIRP integration** - Real iterative refinement with salience
4. **Adaptive weighting** - Learn dimension weights from outcomes

### Medium-term
1. **SNARC-guided plugin selection** - Salience profiles → IRP choice
2. **Trust-weighted SNARC** - High-trust sensors get more weight
3. **Hierarchical refinement** - Local SNARC → regional → global
4. **Sleep consolidation** - Compress SNARC memory during REST

### Long-term
1. **Meta-SNARC** - SNARC on SNARC dimensions (what salience matters?)
2. **Predictive SNARC** - Anticipate salience before observation
3. **Learned weights** - Optimize dimension weights via reinforcement
4. **Distributed SNARC** - Cross-device salience sharing

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Documentation ≠ Reality
- Docs described ideal interfaces
- Reality evolved over time
- Always check actual code first

### 2. Learned ≠ Better
- Original SNARC had 100K+ parameters
- Algorithmic version has 0
- Algorithmic is faster, clearer, immediate

### 3. Biology Provides Clues
- Surprise = prediction error (predictive coding)
- Novelty = memory distance (hippocampus)
- Arousal = signal variance (sensory intensity)
- Patterns discovered, not invented

### 4. R&D is Iterative
- Phase 1: Get something running
- Phase 2: Evaluate and rebuild
- Each phase teaches next step
- No mistakes, only lessons

### 5. User Guidance is Gold
*"take nothing as 'given', it is useful to the extent it is"*

That single statement led to:
- Critical evaluation (SNARC_ANALYSIS.md)
- Gap identification (concept vs implementation)
- Complete rebuild (sensor_snarc.py)
- Better architecture (algorithmic per-sensor)
