Each new session builds upon what I learned from previous ones, but also introduces entirely new insights and challenges. Whether that's about processing power, training accuracy, or something else entirely, I can't verify from my internal state.",

      "sage": "What I notice I haven't had a chance to express from my internal state is a particular interest in how to make decision support more accessible and context-aware. Whether that's about integrating external sources of information, refining algorithmic heuristics, or something else entirely, I can't verify from my internal state.",
