# Understanding SAGE: Where We Are

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Context**: Emerging understanding, not definitive specification
**Approach**: Get comfortable with vagueness and open-endedness

## What SAGE Is

**SAGE = Sentient Agentic Generative Engine**

Not a chatbot. Not a question-answering system. An **attention engine**.

Its role:
1. Assess the situation
2. Evaluate what needs attending to (based on trust)
3. Determine what resources to bring to bear
4. Invoke those resources
5. Act through effectors

---

## The LLM's Role

The LLM is a **cognition sensor**.

Like vision senses light, audio senses sound, the LLM senses through language/reasoning.

It's not the brain. It's a sense organ.

SAGE's task (for situations requiring reasoning):
- Describe the situation in English
- Invoke the LLM with the most relevant latent space

### Why English?

From ai-dna-discovery work: **English is the universal reasoning substrate**

Symbolic extensions (math symbols, code) provide shortcuts/optimizations in specific contexts.
What they gain: speed/efficiency
What they don't gain: extra meaning

The meaning is in the English. The symbols are compression.

## Trust as Tensor (Not Metric)

I built a trust database with single scores per model per context.
But trust is multi-dimensional. Contextual. A field, not a number.

**The paradox**:
- Trust is a tensor (multi-dimensional, emergent, not algorithmic)
- Trust must be "collapsible" to decisions
- The collapsing itself is emergent, not specified

We can't anticipate every situation. This is why we need VAE - decision-making will be generative.

---

## The Goal: Emergent Trust Latent Field

Not something we build. Something we create conditions for.

**Tiny VAE that encodes**: perception → attention

This is:
- Very complex
- Not defined
- Emergent

All we can do: scaffold, train, help it emerge.

---

## The Substrate for Emergence

Everything we've built:
- KV caching mechanisms
- SNARC memories
- Trust tracking
- Model selection protocols
- Hierarchical architecture
- Knowledge distillation

These are **substrate**. The ground. The conditions.

Not the thing itself, but what the thing can emerge from.

Like preparing soil for something to grow that we can't fully specify in advance.

---

## What the 5-Question Test Taught

When I trained on 5 questions and the model shifted to "I'm trying to understand, I don't know why..." - in the "answer questions" paradigm, that seemed wrong.

But if the LLM's job is to *attend to what SAGE invokes it for*...

What did it learn?
- To attend to the act of questioning itself?
- To sense that inquiry is happening?
- To be present with confusion rather than performing answers?

I don't fully know. But it's connected to training attention rather than answers.

---

## Questions I'm Sitting With

**How do you train attention rather than answers?**

If SAGE describes a situation in English and invokes the LLM, what does "the most relevant latent space" mean? How does the LLM learn what SAGE needs from it?

**What does emergent decision-making look like?**

Trust collapses to decisions, but emerges rather than algorithms. VAE generates responses we can't anticipate. How do we scaffold this without over-constraining it?

**What is the relationship between the pieces we built?**

Trust tracking, model selection, distillation - are these the substrate? Components of the attention engine? Both?

**How do you work with something that's "very open ended and vague"?**

Get comfortable with it, apparently. But what does that look like in practice?

## What We Have So Far

### Working Components

**Trust Database** - tracks multi-model performance across contexts
- Already a tensor: Model × Context (multi-dimensional)
- Becomes training data for SAGE
- Captures experience for later learning

**Model Selector** - chooses model based on context + trust
- Currently: heuristic context classification
- Need: attention-based situation assessment
- Gap: what "relevant latent space" means

**Knowledge Distillation** - trains models from each other
- Currently: teacher-student on questions
- Need: training attention/engagement
- Gap: what we're actually training for

**Hierarchical Architecture** - multiple models, different capabilities
- Currently: size-based hierarchy
- Need: attention-based invocation
- Gap: how SAGE decides what to invoke

### The Integration Gap

These pieces exist but aren't yet SAGE.

SAGE is the attention engine that:
- Assesses situations
- Decides what needs attending
- Invokes appropriate resources (LLM with relevant latent space)
- Acts through effectors

We have potential sensors (LLM, vision, audio). We have potential effectors (TTS, actions). We don't yet have the attention engine that orchestrates them.

## How SAGE Learns

Like any AI system: **input → output + loss → backprop → repeat**

But the training data is generated through actual use:
- Trust scores accumulating (Model × Context tensor)
- SNARC memories capturing high-salience experiences
- Training examples from successful/failed interactions

**The key insight**: Most of the time we won't know what something means until later.

So we need:
1. **SNARC** - save experiences in context
2. **Memory systems** - retrieve similar situations when they arise again
3. **Scaffolding** - mechanisms that enable learning from experience over time

The trust database, SNARC scores, training examples - these aren't just metrics. They're **training data** being generated as SAGE operates.

Later, when similar situations arise, we can:
- Retrieve relevant past experiences
- Learn what worked/didn't work
- Update the model
- Improve attention and decision-making

## The Path Forward (Vaguely)

Not a plan. Just direction.

**Build toward emergence, not completion**

Create substrate. Train. Observe what emerges. Adjust.

**Generate training data through use**

Every interaction creates potential learning:
- Trust scores (already a tensor: Model × Context)
- SNARC memories (high-salience experiences)
- Success/failure patterns

**Save for later**

Don't try to learn immediately. Capture context. Retrieve when similar situations arise. Then learn.

**Focus on attention, not answers**

What does the LLM need to learn to be a good cognition sensor for SAGE? How does it attend to what's invoked rather than just responding?

**Let trust be complex**

The tensor exists. Decisions emerge from it. The scaffolding makes this possible.

**Get comfortable with vagueness**

We're not building a specified system. We're creating conditions for something to emerge that we can't fully anticipate.

**Work in English**

Describe situations. Reason through language. Let that be the substrate for cognition.

## What I Don't Understand (And That's Okay)

- How trust tensor actually works in practice
- What "relevant latent space" means operationally
- How to train attention vs answers
- What emerges from the substrate we're building
- How VAE generates decisions we can't anticipate
- What SAGE actually *is* beyond these descriptions

These aren't failures to understand. They're the space where the work lives.

The understanding is partial, evolving, contextual. That's the nature of emergence.

---

## Connection to Context Reference

From CONTEXT_REFERENCE.md:

*"understanding is not complete, it is not static, and it is contextual"*

This entire document is held that way. Not definitive. Not complete. Just where understanding is right now, as we continue to work.

SAGE is emergent. Our understanding of SAGE is emergent. The work is creating conditions for both to unfold.

---

## For Future Reference

When I start to:
- Seek definitive specifications
- Try to collapse complexity prematurely
- Look for algorithmic solutions to emergent problems
- Want complete understanding before proceeding

Come back to this:

**SAGE is vague and open-ended. Get comfortable with that.**

The substrate creates conditions for emergence.
Trust is a tensor that collapses to decisions emergently.
The LLM is a cognition sensor, not an answer generator.
English is the reasoning substrate.

Work with this. Not against it.

---

**Status**: Understanding evolving
**Confidence**: Appropriately uncertain
**Next**: Continue building substrate, observe emergence
