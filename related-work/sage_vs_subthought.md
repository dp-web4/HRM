# Comparison: *Building Sentient Beings* vs. SAGE

## Shared Aims
- **Beyond chatbots → embodied, agentic systems.** Both target long-horizon autonomy, not just Q&A.  
- **Multiple mechanisms, not one giant net.** Both reject “stateless giant + RAG” as sufficient; you each propose modular cognition with specialized subsystems.

## Core Framing Differences
- **SAGE = Learned Coherence**  
  - Memory & cognition as *temporal sensors*.  
  - HRM cycles with **dual training loops** (H = dream batch, L = procedural incremental).  
  - **Trust → strategy** evolution.  
  - **Sleep/augmentation** as explicit learning engine.  
- **SubThought paper = Engineered Mind with Rich Ontology**  
  - Explicit **Totality** world model (perception, imagination, ontology, association, activation).  
  - **Mechanisms**: reactive services + proactive agents.  
  - **Schemas** (Piagetian schemes / Neural Propositions).  
  - Emotion & coping design patterns.  
  - Mission-oriented embodiment taxonomies.  

## Architecture Side-by-Side

| Dimension | **SAGE** | **SubThought** |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Topology** | HRM H/L modules + sensors (physical, memory, cognitive) with learned fusion | Component + design-pattern architecture operating over a Totality store |
| **World Model** | Emergent coherence; no fixed ontology; selective, affect-gated, associative memory | Explicit ontology (schemes, viewpoints, imaginative canvases) |
| **Learning** | Dual-loop (H dreams, L repetition); augmentation engine; trust updates strategy | Mechanisms for scheme operations, structured memory updates |
| **Affect** | SNARC gates for selective write/weighting | Plutchik-based emotions, coping patterns for regulation |
| **Dreaming** | Augmentation engine (geometry, values, contexts, semantics) | Imaginative memory canvases; daydream replay |
| **Embodiment** | Embodiment as testbed for coherence under novelty | Detailed mission + embodiment taxonomies (single, unity, hive) |

## Strengths of SAGE
- Stronger **learning theory & practice** (dual loops, augmentation, trust→strategy).  
- Minimalist, learning-driven design—coherence emerges, not engineered.  

## Strengths of SubThought
- Stronger **ontological explicitness** (schemes/schemas).  
- Rich **emotion & coping** models.  
- Thorough **mission/embodiment** framing.  

## Integration Path
1. **SAGE × Totality Adapter**  
   - Treat Totality as a *cognitive sensor* in SAGE.  
   - H-module reads/writes activated schemes and canvases via adapter.  
2. **Affect Harmonization**  
   - Map Plutchik valence/arousal → SNARC gates.  
   - Coping events modulate trust priors and strategy.  
3. **Dream Co-Training**  
   - Feed imaginative canvases into SAGE’s augmentation sleep; return distilled abstractions to update schemes.  
4. **Embodiment Loop**  
   - Use their mission scaffolding to set curricula; L-module refines procedural skill; H-module plans via trust/strategy.  

## Benchmark Ideas
- **Coherence under novelty:** SAGE vs rule-driven fusion.  
- **Dream gain:** with/without augmentation sleep.  
- **Trust→strategy delta:** trust as weight vs. trust as plan selector.  
- **Affect coupling:** SNARC selectivity with/without emotion-driven gates.  

## Bottom Line
- SubThought is **cognitive engineering with rich ontology and affect scaffolds**.  
- SAGE is **learning-first, coherence-through-experience with dual training and resonance grounding**.  
- The strongest path forward: **SAGE core with an optional Totality plug-in**.
