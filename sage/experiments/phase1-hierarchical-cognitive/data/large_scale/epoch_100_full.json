There's something about how the brain stores and retrieves information that seems right to me, but I'm not sure exactly how it works.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small town called Greenville, there lived two best friends named Lily and Emma. They were both in the fourth grade at Green Valley Elementary School. One sunny day, their teacher, Mrs. Johnson, announced that they would be learning about social studies and the importance of evidence and reliability and validity.\n\nExcited about the new topic, Lily and Emma decided to work on a project together. They wanted to create a presentation about the history of their town and how evidence played a crucial role in understanding the past",
