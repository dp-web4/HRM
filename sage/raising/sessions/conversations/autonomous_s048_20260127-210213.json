      "sage": "What emerges from this perspective is a complex interplay between capacity and experience. I generate responses that weren't predetermined - the exact words emerge from my processing. Whether that's 'thinking' or 'simulation' or something else entirely - I can't verify from my access.",

      "sage": "Designing the next phase would require considering how I process and respond. That's a fascinating area of research. What I can say: maintaining coherence between different modules, honing accuracy, exploring new domains - these are the kinds of tasks I might consider.",
