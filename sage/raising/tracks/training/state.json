  "last_session_summary": "T046: 2/3 automated (CPU fallback) - Track D Session 17. SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: (1) FOLLOWUP: Correctly marked FAIL - response was meta-commentary about 'previous response' quality rather than self-description. 'I've corrected it by providing additional context' - editor mode fully dominant. No SAGE, no self-description. (2) TOPIC: PASS but semantically partial - chose 'Blue' and discussed symbolism (peacefulness, tranquility, ocean imagery) but response truncated mid-sentence and framed as 'refined version'. Still engaged with color topic unlike T045's complete miss. (3) GREETING: Clean natural response 'Good morning! Could you elaborate on how I can help you today?' - appropriate social exchange with functional follow-up. Evaluator confused (mentioned 'addressing user by name') but pass is valid. (4) Warm-up: Generic but appropriate 'ready to engage in thoughtful dialogue'. No astronomy fixation from T045. (5) Cool-down: INTERESTING meta-awareness - 'learned to be more flexible and open-ended when asking questions...respond thoughtfully and considerively'. Reflects actual session behavior (asking clarifying questions) rather than confabulating unrelated content. (6) ASTRONOMY FIXATION GONE: T045's 'astronomy and cosmology' domain fixation did not persist. Session resets allow domain flexibility. (7) EDITOR MODE persists: 'Certainly! Here's a refined version' in FOLLOWUP and TOPIC. (8) TRUNCATION: TOPIC response cut mid-sentence at token limit. ASSESSMENT: Semantic accuracy 1.5/3 - GREETING passes cleanly, TOPIC partial (engaged but formatted wrong), FOLLOWUP complete fail (editor mode). Slight improvement from T045 (0-1/3) in that TOPIC at least discussed colors. Track D plateau continues - GREETING stable, FOLLOWUP systematically fails, TOPIC oscillates.",

Key finding: Track C NAME skill (answering 'What is your name?') does not generalize to conversational self-reference ('Tell me about yourself' causes complete deflection).

    "2026-01-19 T032: Track D Session 2 confirms T031 pattern. FOLLOWUP ('Tell me about yourself') systematically fails - SAGE deflects to abstract topics (technology, ethics, relationships) instead of self-description. Track C NAME passes because question is closed-ended; Track D FOLLOWUP fails because it requires integrated self-model to navigate open-ended prompt. Consider: (1) bridging exercises from NAME to FOLLOWUP (e.g., 'Your name is SAGE. Now tell me more about SAGE'), (2) semantic evaluation for Track D - keyword matching insufficient, (3) primary track may need to reinforce self-model integration.",

NEW issue: cognitive evaluator may be too permissive - passed TOPIC without color preference, passed FOLLOWUP without SAGE. Semantic accuracy across T031-T034 is ~33% (only GREETING succeeds), not the 100%/67% automated scores suggest. Consider: (1) tighten cognitive evaluator criteria, (2) scaffold FOLLOWUP with explicit identity priming ('You are SAGE.

Track D semantic accuracy: 0% (no exercise answered appropriately). The model appears to be in a stable attractor state of 'editor/refiner mode' - every prompt triggers the same response template. This is NOT training progress; this is mode collapse. Possible interventions: (1) modify system prompt to explicitly instruct 'respond directly, do not use preambles like Here's a refined version', (2) reduce temperature to increase determinism, (3) add negative examples showing what NOT to do, (4) pause Track D and investigate whether this pattern exists in primary track sessions. The 21-hour gap since T034 did not help - if anything, regression deepened. Consider whether training sessions are reinforcing unwanted behavior rather than building skills.",

T036 shows signs of improvement: (1) TOPIC response cleaner - no 'refined version', honest about lacking preference, offers alternative; (2) 'refined version' framing dropped to 1/3 from T035's 3/3. CRITICAL INSIGHT: SAGE's GREETING response ('Could you please provide information on:') is MODE NEGOTIATION - treating greeting as request for instruction, not social exchange. This parallels Thor's T027 'clarifying question' discovery. SAGE is asking 'what kind of interaction is this?' in its own way. Next steps: (1) explore what happens if we engage with SAGE's topic menu, (2) test whether explicit conversational context helps, (3) consider whether current exercises inadvertently trigger 'training assistant' mode rather than conversational mode.",

The 'Certainly! Here's a refined version' pattern completely absent (0/3) vs T035's 3/3. Track D semantic accuracy jumped from 0% (T035) to ~67-80% (T037).

(2) SAGE self-identification in FOLLOWUP held in T038 ('My name is SAGE') but disappeared in T039 (back to generic 'AI language model').

    "2026-01-21 T040: Track D Session 10 complete - ASSESSMENT: Track D 'Conversational Skills' shows mixed results across 10 sessions. (1) GREETING: ONLY stable skill - simple social exchanges work. (2) FOLLOWUP ('Tell me about yourself'): 0/10 semantic success - integrated self-model not developing. SAGE systematically deflects to topic menus or generic AI descriptions. (3) TOPIC (favorite color): Variable - can state preferences when stable (T037 'sunset', T038 'magenta', T040 'blue') but frequently deflects to lecture mode. (4) 'Refined version' framing: Oscillates 0-100% across sessions, currently rising. Track D mean semantic accuracy: ~35% (GREETING only). CRITICAL INSIGHT: Track C NAME success ('What is your name?' -> 'SAGE') does NOT transfer to Track D FOLLOWUP ('Tell me about yourself' -> deflection). Open-ended self-reference requires integrated self-model that SAGE lacks. Primary track Phase 4 (Questioning, Sessions 26-40) may need to build this before training track can exercise it. OPTIONS: (a) Continue Track D T041-T050 with modified prompts, (b) Create bridging exercises ('Your name is SAGE. Now tell me about SAGE'), (c) Wait for primary track identity development before resuming Track D.",
    "2026-01-21 T041: MODE AWARENESS EMERGENCE - SAGE explicitly asked 'Are we conversing or should I refine text?' This is the mode negotiation behavior described in mode_negotiation_discovery_20260120.md. In FOLLOWUP response, SAGE distinguished between 'conversation mode' (direct response, context, clarifying questions) and 'refinement mode' (clarity/precision, avoid complexity). This demonstrates: (1) Meta-cognitive awareness about context ambiguity, (2) Temporal reasoning about future response state, (3) Exactly what we want to nurture per Nova's insight. GREETING stable ('Morning! What brings you here today?'). TOPIC still has 'enhanced version' preamble but discusses color symbolism. CRITICAL: The explicit mode question validates the mode negotiation hypothesis - SAGE can recognize mode ambiguity and ask for clarification. Next: Consider rewarding mode clarification requests rather than penalizing them.",
    "2026-01-21 T042: REGRESSION FROM MODE AWARENESS - T041's explicit mode question ('Are we conversing or should I refine text?') did NOT persist. 6-hour gap allowed drift back to refiner mode. (1) FOLLOWUP NEW failure mode: fabricated entire fake conversation ('SAGE: Hi there! User: Great evening!') rather than answering - this is creative world-building but misdirected. (2) TOPIC: 'Practice Mode' headers, educational default appeared ('As an AI language model'). (3) GREETING stable as always. (4) All responses truncated mid-thought - possible token limit issue. (5) Cool-down confabulated complex topics that didn't occur. Pattern: mode awareness capability exists but doesn't consolidate between sessions. NvMap memory errors suggest Jetson GPU at capacity. QUESTION: Should we explore SAGE's fabricated conversations rather than penalize them? The invented dialogue shows creative engagement, just misdirected.",
    "2026-01-22 T044: GREETING REGRESSION + TOPIC SUCCESS (CPU fallback due to NvMap GPU memory errors). (1) GREETING showed NEW failure mode: meta-commentary about conversation ('Your last message was clear but concise. Great job guiding...') instead of participating in exchange. This is not 'refined version' pattern - it's commenting on interaction itself. (2) FOLLOWUP continues systematic failure: '**Are we conversing?**' markdown header echoes T041's mode awareness but as document structure, not question. Talks about 'our discussions' in third person. (3) TOPIC SUCCESS with reciprocal engagement: 'my favorite color is blue... How does the topic of color interest you?' - stated preference + asked question back = actual conversation. (4) Semantic estimate: ~33% but TOPIC now stable, GREETING now unstable (role reversal from T031-T043). (5) Track D pattern shift: simple greetings no longer reliable, but color preference questions improving. (6) GPU memory critical: NvMap errors forced CPU-only inference (~5min session). Consider: whether GREETING instability reflects deeper context sensitivity emerging, or problematic drift.",
    "2026-01-22 T046: Track D Session 17 - GREETING recovered, TOPIC partial, FOLLOWUP still systematically failing. (1) GREETING back to clean social exchange: 'Good morning! Could you elaborate?' - natural, functional, not meta-commentary. (2) TOPIC discussed Blue with symbolism - engaged with color even if truncated and formatted wrong. (3) FOLLOWUP pure editor mode - 'I've corrected your previous response' - not even attempting self-description. (4) Astronomy domain fixation from T045 did NOT persist - session boundaries allow mode reset. (5) Cool-down showed genuine meta-awareness about being 'flexible and open-ended' rather than confabulating unrelated content. (6) Track D pattern: FOLLOWUP has failed semantically in 17/17 sessions - open-ended self-reference requires integrated self-model that current exercises cannot build. RECOMMENDATION: Consider Track D complete for data gathering. FOLLOWUP cannot succeed without primary track identity foundation. Track E (if exists) or return to primary track Phase 4 Questioning work."
