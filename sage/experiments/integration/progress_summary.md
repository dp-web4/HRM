# SAGE Integration - Progress Summary

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Session**: Autonomous exploration

---

## What Was Discovered

### 1. Baseline Behavior
- SAGE kernel runs safely without sensors
- Gracefully handles empty observations (no crashes)
- Reveals question: "What IS salience without input?"

### 2. SNARC Limitations
- **No prediction model**: Can't distinguish predictable from random
- **Binary novelty**: "Seen before" vs "new" - too simple
- **Zero surprise**: No expectation → no surprise metric
- **No pattern detection**: Time/noise/heartbeat all treated identically

**Implication**: SNARC needs context/goals to assess salience meaningfully

### 3. Exploration Problem
- **Pure exploitation**: Locks onto first successful sensor (100% of time)
- **No exploration**: Never samples alternatives
- **Works too well**: Reward mechanism functions, but too greedy

**Biological systems**: Balance exploration (curiosity) with exploitation (efficiency)
**SNARC currently**: 100% exploitation, 0% exploration

## Decisions Made

**Don't perfect SNARC before integration**

Reasons:
1. Could spend weeks refining one component
2. Real behavior emerges from interaction
3. Audio integration will reveal what's actually needed
4. Premature optimization wastes effort

**Move forward to audio**:
- Use SNARC as-is
- Document behaviors that emerge
- Fix what breaks
- Add features when actually needed

## Next: Audio Integration

### Approach
Start simple, observe, iterate:

1. **Minimal audio test**: Speech detection only
   - Microphone sensor
   - Print when speech detected
   - No response yet
   - **Goal**: Verify sensor works

2. **Echo loop**: Speak → hear back
   - Add TTS response
   - Simple "you said X" replies
   - **Goal**: Complete cycle works

3. **Add intelligence**: LLM processing
   - Contextual responses
   - Memory integration
   - **Goal**: Actual conversation

4. **Multi-modal**: Audio + vision
   - Test attention switching
   - See if exploration problem appears
   - **Goal**: Discover real constraints

## Implementation Philosophy

**From this session**:
- Run experiments, not just plan them
- Document surprises, not predictions
- Follow discoveries where they lead
- Don't seek completion, seek understanding

**Not**: "Complete baseline, then move to next phase"
**But**: "Explore until something interesting emerges, then follow that"

## Tools Built

Created experimental infrastructure:
- `baseline_sage_test.py` - Zero sensor validation
- `minimal_sensor_test.py` - Time/noise/heartbeat comparison
- `multi_sensor_attention_test.py` - Differential reward testing
- Observation documents for each discovery

These aren't "deliverables" - they're instruments for discovering how the system behaves.

## Lessons

### 1. The System Teaches Us
SNARC's pure exploitation wasn't predicted - it was discovered by running experiments.

### 2. Failures Are Data
The fact that SNARC treats all sensors identically isn't a "bug" - it reveals what's missing (prediction models).

### 3. Research IS Implementation
Running code and observing behavior IS the research. Not separate phases.

### 4. Don't Seek Closure
Could add exploration mechanisms to SNARC now. But that might not be what's actually needed. Find out by integrating audio and seeing what breaks.

## Status

**Explored**: SNARC behavior patterns
**Discovered**: No prediction, pure exploitation, needs context
**Next**: Audio integration (simple → complex)
**Philosophy**: Observe, don't perfect

Ready to continue.
