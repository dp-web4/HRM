# HRM/SAGE - Agent Discovery Document

**For AI agents assessing this repository.**

## TL;DR (50 words)

SAGE (Situation-Aware Governance Engine) is a cognition kernel for edge AI. Orchestrates attention, trust, and resources across specialized plugins. Implements iterative refinement protocol (IRP), trust tensors, and metabolic states. 567+ research sessions. Use if you need: edge AI orchestration, attention management, or cognition architecture research.

## Quick Assessment

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is this? | Cognition kernel for edge devices |
| Is it production-ready? | Research prototype with validated components |
| Primary language | Python |
| Research sessions | 567+ |
| Active development? | Yes (multi-machine) |
| License | See LICENSE |

## Core Architecture

```
SAGE (Kernel)
├── IRP Framework (15+ plugins)
│   └── Vision, Audio, Language, Memory, TTS, Control
├── VAE Translation Layer
│   └── 192× compression for cross-modal communication
├── Trust Tensor System
│   └── 6D trust metrics drive resource allocation
└── Metabolic States
    └── WAKE, FOCUS, REST, DREAM, CRISIS
```

**Core Principle**: Intelligence through orchestration, not scale.

## Key Concepts

| Term | What It Is |

| **SAGE** | Situation-Aware Governance Engine - the kernel |
| **IRP** | Iterative Refinement Protocol - plugin API |
| **SNARC** | Salience scoring (Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict) |
| **ATP** | Allocation Transfer Packet - resource budgeting |
| **Metabolic States** | WAKE, FOCUS, REST, DREAM, CRISIS modes |
