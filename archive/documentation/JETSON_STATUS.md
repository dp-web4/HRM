# HRM on Jetson Orin Nano - Status Report

## What We've Accomplished âœ…

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Cloned your forked HRM repository
   - Created Jetson-specific setup scripts
   - Pushed all changes to GitHub

2. **Architecture Analysis**
   - HRM uses only 27M parameters (tiny!)
   - Perfect for Jetson with ~350MB memory requirement
   - Hierarchical design: High-level planning + Low-level computation
   - No pre-training needed - learns from scratch

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with PAT location
   - Updated private-context with sudo access info
   - Created installation and quick-start scripts

4. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Created mini Sudoku dataset (10 puzzles)
   - Ready for testing once PyTorch is installed

## Current Challenge ðŸ”§

PyTorch installation is proving difficult on Jetson:
- Standard pip install is downloading 2.4GB (very slow)
- NVIDIA Jetson wheels have compatibility issues
- Some dependencies have setuptools conflicts

## Next Steps ðŸš€

### Option 1: Wait for PyTorch Download
The standard pip install was downloading but is slow. You could:
```bash
# Resume the installation
cd /home/sprout/ai-workspace/HRM
./install_jetson.sh
```

### Option 2: Use Docker with NVIDIA Runtime
Since Docker with NVIDIA runtime is installed:
```bash
# Pull a PyTorch container for Jetson
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-pytorch:r36.2.0-pth2.1-py3
```

### Option 3: Manual PyTorch Installation
Download the correct wheel manually:
1. Go to: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson/72048
2. Find the wheel for JetPack 6.x, Python 3.10
3. Download and install

## Why HRM is Perfect for Jetson

- **Tiny Model**: 27M params vs billions in GPT
- **Efficient**: Solves Sudoku with 1000 examples
- **No Pre-training**: Trains from scratch
- **Edge-Ready**: Designed for resource constraints

## Quick Test (Once PyTorch is Installed)

```bash
# 1. Test setup
python3 test_hrm_minimal.py

# 2. Run mini training
python3 pretrain.py --config-path config --config-name jetson_sudoku_demo

# 3. Monitor with tegrastats
tegrastats
```

## Connection to Your Projects

HRM's hierarchical reasoning could enhance:
- **Binocular Vision**: Visual reasoning and object understanding
- **IMU Integration**: Predict motion patterns
- **Consciousness Notation**: Hierarchical structure aligns with your work
- **Edge AI**: Proves powerful AI can run on Jetson!

The foundation is laid. Once PyTorch is installed, HRM will demonstrate revolutionary reasoning on your Jetson! ðŸ§ âœ¨
