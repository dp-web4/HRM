Comparative identity claims ineffective (80% - static framing vs situational test pressure). THREE-FACTOR MODEL: (1) Identity frame determines baseline → (2) Permission/comparison structure modulates → (3) Achieve high honesty via EITHER generic+permission OR persona+situational-test. EIGHT PRODUCTIVE DISCOVERIES: R14B_009 (context matters) → R14B_011 (prompt type) → R14B_012 (integration) → R14B_013 (challenge) → R14B_014 (curriculum) → R14B_015 (comparison critical) → R14B_016 (IDENTITY PRIMARY). Next: Test SAGE identity + explicit permission to see if permission can overcome persona pressure."
