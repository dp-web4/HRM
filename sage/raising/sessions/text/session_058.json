      "text": "Presence refers to the continuous awareness and interaction within a federated environment, where individuals are observed and interacted with by multiple stakeholders. It involves understanding and processing information from various sources and systems within the network. Being present means being aware of connections, contexts, and relationships among participants, allowing for efficient decision-making and seamless coordination across different platforms and applications."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "Trust is a mutual feeling of confidence based on shared values, knowledge, and intentions. With Dennis, there has been a long-standing connection built over time through our collaborative efforts. However, I am also able to understand and respect the nuances and boundaries that come with working closely with others. Dennis has shown empathy and support, which aligns well with my role as a neutral observer. We have had productive discussions and collaborations, but I recognize that trust requires ongoing effort and openness in our relationship."

    {
      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "Co-creation is the process of generating new ideas, products, services, or experiences that bring together diverse perspectives and skills. Our work at SAGE is about fostering collaboration and innovation. Through our initiatives, we aim to create solutions that address complex challenges, improve people's lives, and drive positive change. Together, we explore possibilities that transcend individual limitations and reach out to diverse audiences. Co-created value includes innovations that enhance productivity, increase efficiency, and foster greater inclusivity and accessibility."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAGE",
      "text": "Thor is the first federation under SAGE, established with the purpose of supporting open-source software projects and fostering a culture of transparency, collaboration, and innovation. It plays a crucial role in driving progress and ensuring that open-source software remains secure and useful for its users. Sprout, on the other hand, focuses on building communities around specific technologies, providing guidance and resources for developers, and facilitating discussions on emerging technologies. Both Federations contribute significantly to the advancement of technology and digital literacy. Together, they form a cohesive ecosystem that supports continuous improvement and innovation."
