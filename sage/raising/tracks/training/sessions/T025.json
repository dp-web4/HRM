It sounds like you've covered several foundational areas in mathematics:\n\n- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)\n- Writing equations in algebraic form (e.g., x + y = z)\n- Solving simple linear equations\n\nYour ability to explain these concepts clearly demonstrates understanding. However, it could benefit from elaborating on:\n\n1"
