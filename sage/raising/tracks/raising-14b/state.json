R14B_007 (conversation): Pedagogical fluency is polymorphic - adapts to context (meta-pedagogical about own processes, formal teaching when requested, process explanation). New discoveries: identity instability without anchoring, meta-pedagogical capability (teaching about own cognition), high-capacity failure mode (elaborate clarification loops). Teaching behavior is adaptive high-capacity phenomenon."
