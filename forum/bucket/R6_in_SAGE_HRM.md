# R6 in the Context of SAGE/HRM

## Origins in Web4

In the **Web4 framework**, R6 is defined as:

**R6 = Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource → Result**

This is the fundamental unit of accountable action, designed to ensure that every action is transparent, purposeful, and traceable. Its six components are:

- **Rules** — inherent constraints (e.g., governance, protocols, safety boundaries) that channel behavior.  
- **Role** — contextual operational identity, with permissions/responsibilities encoded by Linked Context Tokens (LCTs).  
- **Request** — the intent, framed with acceptance criteria, quality thresholds, and priorities.  
- **Reference** — the temporal context/memory, defined within the Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH).  
- **Resource** — the energy, compute, and attention budget (e.g., ATP/ADP cycles) that can be invested.  
- **Result** — the actual outcome, with comparison to intent providing the basis for trust updates.

In Web4, R6 is composable, hierarchical, and naturally forms a governance mechanism. Each action leaves an **indelible footprint**: the R6 tuple, the resource spend, witness marks, trust updates, and integration into collective memory.

## Application to SAGE/HRM

In **SAGE (Sentient Agentic Generative Engine)**, with the **HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Model)** as its awareness core, R6 provides the operational skeleton for awareness and agency.

- **Rules** → IRP plugin constraints, effector safety boundaries, and system-level policies.  
- **Role** → roles assigned to each plugin/agent (e.g., Vision IRP, Planning LLM, Diffusion Detector, Motor Effector), governed by their own LCTs.  
- **Request** → the existential puzzles HRM frames, or higher-level tasks it receives. These define what success looks like.  
- **Reference** → SAGE’s memory layers (SNARC for novelty/arousal, exact recall, compressed wisdom, associative links), all contextualized within MRH.  
- **Resource** → compute cycles, sensor bandwidth, energy allocation, and attention windows available for processing and effectors.  
- **Result** → the solution to the puzzle (e.g., transformed latent, effector action), logged back into memory and trust structures for evaluation.

## Why This Matters

- R6 ensures that **puzzle solving in HRM is never context-free** — every action is constrained, role-bound, and resourced.  
- It provides a **consistent accountability framework** that mirrors the Web4 trust system.  
- It bridges **local latent spaces** (each domain’s sovereignty) with the **shared puzzle space** that HRM uses for orchestration.  
- By integrating R6, SAGE inherits Web4’s strengths: composability, traceability, confidence gating, and emergent governance.

## Next Steps

We are not yet implementing R6 directly inside SAGE. Instead, the current goal is:

1. Build scaffolding (SensorVAE → PuzzleVAE → EffectorVAE).  
2. Validate HRM’s ability to operate over puzzle abstractions.  
3. Use R6 as the **lens and log structure** for evaluating decisions and coherence during early prototypes.  

This aligns SAGE development with the **governance DNA of Web4**, ensuring that awareness, agency, and sentience grow within a principled accountability framework.
