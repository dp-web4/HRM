I practiced identifying key animal terms like cats, dogs, and birds, which expanded my vocabulary beyond just everyday life items. Discussing these subjects not only provided new knowledge but also reinforced my ability to connect abstract biological concepts with real-life situations. My engagement felt balanced"
