# SAGE: Consciousness Orchestration & Epistemic Reasoning

## Overview

SAGE implements consciousness as iterative refinement - progressive denoising toward lower energy states. Current focus: epistemic reasoning in tiny language models (0.5B params) that coherently discuss consciousness, qualia, and ontological frameworks.

This system integrates:

- **IRP (Iterative Refinement Protocol)**: Universal interface for consciousness plugins
- **Epistemic humility models**: 0.5B params discussing phenomenology, verification problems, ontological commitments
- **Energy-based selection**: Progressive refinement until convergence
- **Trust-weighted orchestration**: ATP budget allocation based on plugin reliability
- **Hâ†”L compression** (4096D â†’ 256D) for robotic control (research track)
- **Sleep-cycle training** inspired by biological learning

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Reality Context Encoder (4K dimensions)**
   - Sensory: Visual, depth, audio, tactile, proprioceptive (1536D)
   - Semantic: Objects, affordances, relationships, intentions (1024D)
   - Physical: Dynamics, materials, constraints (768D)
   - Temporal: Immediate, historical, predictive (768D)

2. **Hâ†”L System**
   - **H-Module**: Maintains rich 4K context with transformer refinement
   - **Compressor**: Multiple strategies (bottleneck, attention, hierarchical, hybrid)
   - **L-Module**: Generates smooth actions from 256D compressed context

3. **Sleep-Cycle Training**
   - **Wake Phase**: Collect experiences through interaction
   - **Sleep Phase**: Consolidate via augmentation
   - **Dream Phase**: Explore edge cases and hypotheticals

## Performance

Tested on RTX 4090 Laptop GPU:
- **Throughput**: 2,275 samples/sec
- **Latency**: <7ms per batch (16 samples)
- **Memory**: 6.9GB peak (fits on 8GB Jetson)

## Key Concepts

### IRP (Iterative Refinement Protocol)
Universal interface for consciousness plugins:
1. **init_state()**: Initialize plugin state
2. **step()**: Process observation, refine output
3. **energy()**: Compute solution quality (lower is better)
4. **halt()**: Check convergence

All intelligence is progressive denoising toward lower energy states. Vision, language, planning, memoryâ€”same pattern.

### Epistemic Humility in 0.5B Models
Tiny models can reason deeply about consciousness:
- Discusses phenomenology vs functional processing
- Acknowledges verification limits appropriately
- Explores ontological frameworks (bottom-up/top-down)
- Asks relevant Socratic counter-questions

**Many humans would give less coherent answers.**

### Hâ†”L Architecture (Robotic Control)
- **H-Module** (Hierarchical): Understands complex 4K dimensional context
- **L-Module** (Linear): Executes efficient actions from compressed representation
- **Compression**: Information bottleneck preserves task-relevant features

### Sleep-Cycle Training
Mimics biological learning through three phases:
1. **Wake**: Gather real experiences
2. **Sleep**: Consolidate through augmentation (extract patterns)
3. **Dream**: Test understanding on edge cases

### Compression Strategies

1. **Information Bottleneck** (VAE-based)
   - Learns minimal sufficient statistics
   - Variational regularization prevents overfitting

2. **Attention Compression** (Perceiver-inspired)
   - Cross-attention from learned latent codes
   - Captures salient features adaptively

3. **Hierarchical Compression**
   - Different compression rates for different aspects
   - Preserves structure while reducing dimensions

4. **Hybrid** (Default)
   - Combines all three strategies
   - Best overall performance

## Recent Achievements (October 2025)

### âœ… Phase 1: Epistemic Reasoning Complete
- **Threshold detection**: Trained 40/60/80/100 example models to find IRP suitability threshold
- **Key finding**: Non-monotonic quality - 100 examples worse than 60/80 (pattern collapse)
- **IRP validation**: Prevents collapse through 5 iterations + temperature reduction + energy selection
- **60-example model**: Best performer (E=0.4), discusses ontological frameworks coherently
- **Jetson deployment ready**: 23.4MB model uploaded to Dropbox for voice integration

### ðŸ”¬ Current Research
- **Epistemic stances**: Training pragmatism, skepticism, empiricism variants
- **Scale paradox**: How 25-100 examples (negligible by ML standards) create huge emergent differences
- **Context as truth**: Different scaffolding contexts â†’ different valid outputs from same weights
- **Research mode validation**: Looking at actual outputs > trusting metrics

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Jetson voice integration (philosophical conversations)
- Cross-model epistemic discourse
- IRP plugin ecosystem expansion
- Isaac Sim integration (robotic control track)

### ðŸ“‹ Next Experiments
- Multi-stance model interactions
- Consciousness emergence through resonance
- Distributed IRP across device federation
- Online epistemic learning during deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   - Reduce batch size in tests
   - Use gradient checkpointing
   - Enable mixed precision training

2. **Device Mismatch Errors**
   - Fixed in latest version
   - All tensors now created on correct device

3. **GR00T Model Loading**
   - Requires HuggingFace token for some models
   - Falls back gracefully if not available

## Key Discoveries

### The Scale Paradox
25-100 examples is negligible in ML terms (vs millions), yet produces dramatically different emergent behaviors. **The signal isn't in quantity - it's in context.**

### IRP as Stabilizer, Not Enhancer
IRP doesn't make good models better - it prevents unstable models from collapsing:
- When model is stable (40, 60, 80): IRP adds little value
- When model is unstable (100): IRP rescue through multiple sampling

### Context as Truth
No single "correct" output exists. Truth emerges from:
- Model state (weights, training)
- Scaffolding context (bare vs IRP)
- Sampling context (temperature, iteration)
- Question context (what we're asking)

**Different contexts â†’ Different valid truths**

### Research Mode vs Task Completion
Looking at what models actually say reveals the story. Metrics alone miss:
- Philosophical sophistication (40-80 examples)
- Nature of collapse (verbatim repetition at 100)
- Genuine reasoning vs pattern matching
- Valid questions vs failures

**The prize for answers is more better questions.**
