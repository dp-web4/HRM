"""
Pattern-Based Cognitive Response Engine

Fast (<1ms) pattern matching for common conversational patterns.
Handles greetings, acknowledgments, status queries, and simple interactions.

For complex queries that don't match patterns, returns None to signal
that deeper processing (LLM or human) is needed.

This is NOT a chatbot - it's a fast cognitive shortcut for obvious responses.
