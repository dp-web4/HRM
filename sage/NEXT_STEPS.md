# SAGE Next Steps: Context-First Development

*Date: September 12, 2025*  
*Moving from theory to implementation*

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Formalize Context Encoding System
**Goal**: Expand the 16D prototype into comprehensive context representation

**Tasks**:
```python
# Define context dimensions formally
class ContextDimensions:
    # Spatial context
    - pattern_type: Enum[extraction, filling, symmetry, ...]
    - size_relationship: Enum[same, smaller, larger, tiled]
    - spatial_density: float [0-1]
    - connectivity: int (connected components)
    
    # Semantic context  
    - color_semantics: Dict[color -> role]
    - object_relationships: List[touching, separate, nested]
    - transformation_type: Enum[geometric, color, structural]
    
    # Temporal context
    - attempt_history: List[previous_attempts]
    - success_patterns: List[what_worked]
    - failure_patterns: List[what_failed]
    
    # Meta context
    - confidence_level: float
    - similarity_to_training: List[Tuple[example_id, score]]
    - computational_budget: int (allowed iterations)
```

**Deliverable**: `context_encoder_v2.py` with formal dimension definitions

### 2. Build Context Retrieval System
**Goal**: Find relevant training examples based on context similarity

**Implementation**:
1. Encode all training examples into context space
2. Build efficient similarity search (FAISS or similar)
3. Retrieve top-k similar examples for any test input
4. Extract transformation rules from similar examples

**Deliverable**: `context_retrieval.py` with example matching

### 3. Separate H and L Training
**Goal**: Train H for context, L for execution

**Approach**:
```python
# H-module training
h_module.train_on(
    inputs=puzzles,
    targets=context_vectors,  # Not solutions!
    objective="context_accuracy"
)

# L-module training  
l_module.train_on(
    inputs=(puzzles, context_vectors),
    targets=solutions,
    objective="execution_accuracy"
)
```

**Deliverable**: `train_h_l_separate.py` with specialized training

### 4. Implement H↔L Communication Protocol
**Goal**: Design efficient context↔action message passing

**Protocol Design**:
```python
class HLMessage:
    # H→L messages
    context_vector: Tensor[16+]  # Context encoding
    confidence: float            # How sure H is
    strategy: str               # Suggested approach
    constraints: List           # What not to do
    
    # L→H messages
    action_taken: Tensor        # What L did
    result_state: Tensor        # Outcome
    success_metric: float       # How well it worked
    needs_clarification: List   # What L is unsure about
```

**Deliverable**: `h_l_communication.py` with message protocol

## Next Phase (Next Month)

### 5. Test Quantization Strategies
**Hypothesis**: H needs precision, L can be quantized

**Experiments**:
- H-module: Keep at FP16 (100M params)
- L-module: Test INT4 (500M) vs Ternary (1B)
- Measure: Context quality vs execution accuracy trade-offs

### 6. Implement Temporal Context Persistence
**Goal**: Maintain context across attempts/sessions

**Features**:
- Save H-state between attempts
- Learn from failed attempts
- Build up problem understanding over time
- Enable "picking up where we left off"

### 7. Multi-Round H↔L Refinement
**Goal**: Iterative context↔action improvement

**Process**:
1. H provides initial context
2. L attempts action
3. H evaluates result, refines context
4. L tries again with better context
5. Repeat until convergence or budget exhausted

### 8. Cross-Domain Context Transfer
**Goal**: Use context from one domain in another

**Test**:
- Train on ARC puzzles
- Test if context transfers to:
  - Visual reasoning tasks
  - Simple programming problems
  - Pattern completion tasks

## Validation Metrics

### Context Quality Metrics
- **Context coherence**: Does context remain stable across attempts?
- **Retrieval accuracy**: Are retrieved examples actually similar?
- **Dimension coverage**: Are all 16+ dimensions meaningful?

### Execution Quality Metrics
- **Task accuracy**: Does L solve puzzles correctly given context?
- **Efficiency**: How many H↔L rounds needed?
- **Generalization**: Does it work on unseen patterns?

### System Metrics
- **Memory usage**: H (FP16) + L (INT4) footprint
- **Inference speed**: Time per puzzle
- **Learning efficiency**: How much training data needed?

## Experimental Validation

### Experiment 1: Context vs No Context
- Baseline: Current SAGE V3 (no explicit context)
- Test: SAGE with H↔L context architecture
- Measure: Accuracy improvement

### Experiment 2: Context Retrieval Value
- Baseline: Random example selection
- Test: Context-based example retrieval
- Measure: Relevance of retrieved examples

### Experiment 3: Quantization Impact
- Baseline: Both H and L at FP16
- Test: H at FP16, L at INT4/Ternary
- Measure: Accuracy vs memory trade-off

### Experiment 4: Temporal Learning
- Baseline: Single attempt per puzzle
- Test: Multiple attempts with context persistence
- Measure: Improvement over attempts

## Key Principle

**Remember**: We're not trying to build intelligence from scratch. We're formalizing the context↔action pattern that already exists. Every step should be validated against the question: "Does this help H attend to context better, or help L act within context better?"
