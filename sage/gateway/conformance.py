"""
Governed-harness conformance — GPT's lifecycle (forum, 2026-09-03), run from OUTSIDE hestia
against SAGE's client, so "a harness Hestia did not author can satisfy the same governed
lifecycle" is measured rather than asserted:

    connect + prove key -> receive effective scope/law contract -> propose act
      -> allow/deny/escalate -> receive ruling mid-session -> execute only after valid
      authority -> record outcome -> survive reconnect/replay

Each step reports PASS / FAIL / NOT_YET with evidence. NOT_YET is an honest gap on the daemon
side (FR-1 proof at connect, copied-session refusal — hestia #824), never hidden as a pass.
No outward side effects: consequential acts are gated (verdict only), never dispatched; the
only executed act is a witness attributed to the member.

The report says which gate path it measured (`gate_path`: single-gate | local-law) and whether
hestia_single_gate (#934) was importable (`single_gate`: present | absent: <why>). A 5/0/3 on
local-law is the pre-#934 per-primitive path, NOT the single-gate shim — the column must flip
to single-gate on a #934 engine before the shim can be called conformant (Legion, 2026-09-04).

The report also says WHERE the being's instance resolved (`instance_path`) and whether that is
under one of hestia's temp roots (`under_temp_root`). The gate core treats /tmp and /var/tmp as
scratch space — in scope regardless of MRH — so a runner whose --instance resolves under a /tmp
worktree measures scratch, not governed territory: memory_write flips deny->allow with rule=""
and no grant (Legion, 2026-09-04, replicated on sprout). Step 4 therefore FAILS an allow that
neither a rule nor a grant in the scope status explains ("unspecified allow"), and step 6 FAILS
when a should-not-exist probe lands without such an explanation, and always probes one path
outside the workspace that must be refused whatever the cwd. Pass --instance as the checkout's
absolute path to measure the being's real memory; a 5/0/3 from /tmp is a different measurement.
