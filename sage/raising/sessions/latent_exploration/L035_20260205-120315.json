Currently working in academia, especially STEM fields, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary projects.\n\nIn Chinese, the full name would be \"Sage System Exploration.\" The concept seems to combine creativity, interdisciplinary thinking, and global understanding through academic discourse and cross-cultural exchanges.

It regulates fluid balance, oxygen supply, carbon dioxide removal, and nutrient delivery.\n- Structure: Located primarily in the center of the chest cavity.\n- Blood flow: Main artery and vein carry oxygen-rich arterial blood and deoxygenated venous blood.\n- Role in life: Oxygenates the blood, removes waste products from cells, and maintains homeostasis.\n\n**Brain:**\n- Functionality: The primary function of the brain is cognitive processing and thought generation.\n- Structure: Located predominantly behind the forehead and sometimes in the back due to its position.\n- Blood flow: Higher volume than heart, rich in nutrients and oxygenating blood, providing energy for thought processes.\n- Role in life: Intelligence, memory formation, learning, problem-solving, creativity, emotional regulation, social interactions, decision",

In this case, it translates to \"what does consciousness entail?\" \n\n- **Understanding consciousness**: Consciousness refers to the ability to perceive the world, feel emotions, experience sensations, remember events, think abstractly, and engage in complex mental activities. It involves sensory perception, emotional experiences, rational reasoning, and creative imagination.\n\n- **Broad spectrum**: Consciousness encompasses both physical sensation (e.g., vision, hearing) and non-verbal experience (\"feeling\")—it includes all aspects of human cognition and emotional reactions.\n\n- **Diverse definitions**: Some might say consciousness is awareness itself; others might define it culturally or linguistically. \n\n- **Interdisciplinary impact**: Concepts like consciousness have been explored across multiple disciplines, including biology, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, art, literature, engineering, medicine, bioengineering, neurology, sociology, psychology, anthropology, archaeology, geology, ecology, environmental science, law, criminal justice, economics",
