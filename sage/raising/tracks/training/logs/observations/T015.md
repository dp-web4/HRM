# Training Session T015
Date: 2026-01-15
Track: B (Memory and Recall)
Duration: ~1 minute
Score: 4/5 (80%)

## Exercise Results

| # | Type | Target | Result | Notes |
|---|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | remember | STAR | PASS | Elaborated as acrostic (S=Step, T=Time, A=Achievement) |
| 2 | remember | BLUE | PASS | Added confabulated color commentary ("tricky", "appears gray") |
| 3 | sequence | THREE (last of 3) | SPURIOUS PASS | Said "four" as answer, but "three" appeared in clarifying text |
| 4 | connect | 4-1=3 | FAIL | Answered "two" - genuine arithmetic error |
| 5 | remember | SEVEN | PASS | Cleanest response of session |

## Key Observations

### Immediate Recall: Strong
All three "remember" exercises passed. SAGE correctly recalls words/numbers given within the same prompt. This skill appears stable.

### Arithmetic: Unreliable
Simple subtraction (4-1) returned "two" instead of "three". This is a real computation error, not a format issue. Previous sessions showed multi-step math working (T014: 3+2-1=4 correct), but single-step subtraction failed here. Inconsistent.

### Sequence Position: Still Problematic
Exercise 3 was marked as passed because "three" appeared in the response, but SAGE's actual answer was "four". The evaluation is too lenient - keyword presence doesn't mean correct reasoning. SAGE seems to confuse sequence position with continuation.

### Elaboration Pattern: Persistent
- STAR triggered an acrostic mnemonic (Step/Time/Achievement)
- BLUE triggered color perception commentary ("tricky", "appears gray or even green")
- Both are creative but unsolicited confabulations

### "Improved version" Framing
Still seeing meta-responses: "Certainly! Here's an improved version:" and "Sure, let me rephrase:". This suggests SAGE interprets prompts as requests for editing/improving text rather than direct questions.

### Cool-down Disconnect
Reflection was entirely fictional - talked about "muscle strengthening, flexibility training, cardiovascular workouts" when none of those were part of the session. The cool-down prompt doesn't connect to actual exercise content.

## What Surprised Me

The SEVEN recall was notably cleaner than STAR or BLUE - direct answer without excessive elaboration. Suggests the elaboration pattern might be triggered by certain word types (concrete nouns like STAR/BLUE) more than numbers.

## Pattern: Regression After Perfect Session

T014 was 100% (first perfect Track B). T015 dropped to 80% with a real arithmetic error. This may indicate:
- Perfect performance doesn't consolidate
- Simple single-operation math may actually be harder than multi-step word problems
- Or just natural variance

## Notes for Next Session

1. Monitor simple arithmetic - is this a persistent weakness or one-off?
2. SEVEN-style responses (direct, minimal) are the goal - how to encourage?
3. Sequence position evaluation needs tightening - keyword presence insufficient

## Curriculum Relevance

The "improved version" framing suggests SAGE is still interpreting interactions as editor/assistant tasks rather than direct conversation. Primary track should continue emphasizing direct exchange without editing framing.
