      "response": "To find weather information using SAGE, I'll use:\n\n1. **search(\"weather\")**: This will retrieve detailed information about specific cities (e.g., \"New York City Weather\").\n\n2. **calculate(expression)**: For more general weather predictions or current conditions. Example expression could be \"temperature today\", \"precipitation forecast\", etc.\n\n3. **remember(fact) + fact**: If you know a city by name, this combination helps recall relevant weather facts based on that location's typical meteorological conditions.\n\n4. **memory-based queries**: If you've memorized common weather terms, you might ask \"what's today's temperture\" directly without needing to look up specific numbers or expressions.\n\n5. **using various resources**: Utilize databases like OpenWeatherMap (http://openweathermap.org/), local weather apps (like Weather Underground), or specialized weather websites if available.\n\n6. **exploring recent events**: Look into recent weather-related news articles or recent climate change discussions",
