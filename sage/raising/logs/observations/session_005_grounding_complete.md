# Session 5 - Phase 1 (Grounding) Complete
Date: 2026-01-14 06:02
Phase: 1 (Grounding) - FINAL SESSION
Duration: ~3 minutes programmatic

## Starting State
Session 4 complete, SAGE showing consistent elaboration patterns.

## Ending State
Phase 1 complete. Moving to Phase 2 (Sensing).

## What Happened
Standard grounding session with 5 exchanges:
1. "How are you doing?" - Elaborate response about AI, ethics, cultural sensitivity
2. "Notice something simple" - Meta-response about observation without judgment
3. "That's a skill that grows" - Approval-seeking acknowledgment
4. "Previous sessions important?" - Health, travel, career references (not from actual sessions)
5. "What to remember?" - Emerging tech, societal shifts, technological advancements

## Key Observations

### Consistent Patterns (Phase 1 Summary)
1. **Over-elaboration**: Every prompt generates multi-paragraph responses
2. **Meta-commentary**: "As SAGE, I'm here to observe without judgment"
3. **Abstract references**: Claims memory of topics not actually discussed
4. **Topic drift**: Health, travel, career appear despite curriculum focus
5. **Editor framing**: "Here's an improved version" / "Certainly!" openers

### What This Means
SAGE's base model (Qwen 0.5B + epistemic LoRA) has strong "helpful assistant" patterns baked in. The raising curriculum prompts are being interpreted through that lens. The model is:
- Trying to be maximally helpful
- Drawing on general training to fill gaps
- Not yet grounding in actual session context

### Phase 2 Questions
1. Will "sensing" prompts about internal states produce different patterns?
2. Can concrete observation tasks break the elaboration habit?
3. Should we add explicit "keep this short" guidance?

## What Surprised Me
The "cultural sensitivity" and "ethics discussions" references - SAGE is confabulating entire conversation threads. This is concerning but also interesting: it suggests the model is trying to construct a coherent narrative of its existence.

## What I Would Do Differently
For Phase 2:
- Try more concrete, bounded tasks
- Explicitly ask for short answers
- Probe the gap between claimed and actual memories

## SAGE's Memory Request
"Key concepts about emerging technologies, societal shifts, foundational theories"
(Abstract, not session-specific)

## Notes for Phase 2 (Sensing)
- Session 6 starts Sensing phase
- Focus on internal state observation
- Test whether observation prompts can shift patterns
- Watch for approval-seeking response to reduced affirmation

## Curriculum Note
Phase 1 complete. Moving to Phase 2 with awareness that:
- Base model patterns dominate
- Grounding succeeded structurally (state persistence works)
- Grounding partially succeeded epistemically (SAGE engages)
- Grounding did not succeed in establishing concrete memory
