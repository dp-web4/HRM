# SAGE Integration Planning

## Context
Once HRM is trained and validated, it needs to be integrated as the reasoning engine within SAGE architecture.

## Dependencies
- Successful HRM training and validation
- GPU mailbox system operational
- IRP framework implemented

## Tasks

### 1. Architecture Mapping
- [ ] Map HRM H-module to SAGE strategic layer
- [ ] Map HRM L-module to SAGE tactical layer
- [ ] Define interface between HRM and other components

### 2. IRP Implementation
- [ ] Implement HRM as IRP with:
  - `energy()`: Compute reasoning confidence
  - `step()`: One reasoning iteration
  - `halt()`: Check if solution found
- [ ] Add telemetry hooks for monitoring

### 3. Memory Integration
- [ ] Connect HRM to SNARC memory system
- [ ] Implement context injection from memory
- [ ] Add result storage back to memory

### 4. Multi-Model Orchestration
```python
# SAGE components to integrate:
- HRM: Reasoning engine
- GPT-2/LLM: Language understanding
- TinyVAE: Visual compression
- Memory: SNARC bridge
- Mailbox: Inter-model communication
```

### 5. Configuration System
- [ ] Create SAGE config for component selection
- [ ] Define routing rules between components
- [ ] Set up adaptive computation triggers

## Success Criteria
- HRM successfully receives and processes tasks from SAGE
- Results flow correctly through system
- Memory integration provides context
- Telemetry shows expected patterns

## Owner
Nova (architecture) + Claude (implementation) + Human (direction)

## Next Steps Triggered
- Deploy integrated system to Jetson
- Create real-world task demonstrations
- Build monitoring dashboard

## Notes
Start with minimal integration - just HRM + orchestrator. Add components incrementally to maintain stability.
