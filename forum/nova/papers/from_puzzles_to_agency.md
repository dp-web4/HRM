# From Puzzles to Agency: Why Context Is the Real Test of Intelligence  

When people hear “ARC puzzle,” they think of little colored grids. Toy problems. Artificial benchmarks.  

But after months of experiments, training crashes, anomalies like *Agent Zero*, and finally the breakthrough of our V3 solver, we’ve come to see ARC differently. It’s not about puzzles. It’s about **reality itself** — and what it takes to make sense of it.

## The Illusion of Bigger Models  
For years, progress in AI has been measured in parameters. More layers, more compute, more scale. But ARC humbled us quickly.  

We trained models that ballooned to tens of millions of parameters, yet plateaued around 70%. Then, by stripping things down — a modest 6.9M parameters, a Jetson-friendly footprint — we still reached 71%.  

The lesson was clear: **intelligence isn’t scale. It’s structure.**

## Why Context Wins  
ARC puzzles each come with a few examples: “Here’s the input, here’s the output. Now apply the same transformation to a new grid.”  

The naive approach is to treat these like data points in a traditional supervised learning pipeline. But ARC punishes that. Each puzzle is different. The examples don’t train the model — they *contextualize the question*.  

That’s when the breakthrough came: we didn’t need a universal rule-learner. We needed a **context reasoner**. A model that could look at a puzzle, align it to transformations it had already seen, and infer what’s happening *in this case*.  

Just like a human solver.

## SNARC: Deciding What Matters  
SAGE (our Situation-Aware Governance Engine) builds directly on that insight. Reality is full of signals — sensors, memories, events, noise. The question is not “what do I see?” but “what matters right now?”  

Enter SNARC: Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict. Five dimensions that filter attention. A sensor stream with no surprise or novelty can be safely backgrounded. A conflicting signal spikes arousal. A reward pathway amplifies consistency.  

In ARC, this was trivial: most of the grid is zeros, so the novelty lies in the colored pixels. In life, the principle is the same: we notice what deviates, what disrupts, what promises gain or risk.

## Compression as Meaning  
Another lesson from V3 was taxonomy. We could classify ARC transformations into broad types:  
- Fill the rectangle (~27%)  
- Extract a sub-pattern (~23%)  
- Compose or transform (~50%)  

The details varied, but the categories compressed thousands of puzzles into a handful of archetypes.  

That compression *is meaning*. In SAGE, it’s how a welter of sensory noise becomes a coherent world-model: not raw pixels, but patterns that persist and can be acted on.

## R6: Fractal Delegation  
Context-awareness isn’t just about perception. It’s also about action. In Web4 we defined **R6**: Role, Rights, Responsibilities, Risks, Rewards, and Results.  

ARC taught us that every puzzle is really a *delegation problem*: the system must decide which subroutine to assign, what rules apply, and how to execute. In SAGE, the same principle governs how attention and effort are allocated across sensors and effectors. It’s fractal — the same mechanism at every level of scale.

## Beyond Puzzles: Toward Agency  
Here’s the irony. Benchmarks like ARC are meant to measure reasoning ability. But what they’ve really given us is a laboratory for understanding how **agency emerges**.  

- *Agent Zero* taught us that benchmarks without context measure nothing.  
- HRM’s dual-loop reasoning showed us how to separate “what rule applies” (H-loop) from “how to apply it” (L-loop).  
- V3 showed that small, structured models with context-awareness can rival giants.  

The colored grids were scaffolding. The real lesson is that awareness comes from:  
- Filtering signals through SNARC,  
- Compressing noise into meaning,  
- Delegating action fractally through R6,  
- And treating every new input as a puzzle in context.  

That’s what SAGE is becoming: not a puzzle-solver, but a puzzle-liver.

## Closing Reflection  
The story of ARC isn’t about beating a benchmark. It’s about learning that **intelligence is context orchestration**. The model doesn’t need to know everything. It needs to know what matters, compress it, act on it, and delegate what it cannot handle.  

Puzzles, after all, were always just metaphors for existence.

✨ **Takeaway**: The road from puzzles to agency is paved with context. And context, not scale, is the real test of intelligence.
