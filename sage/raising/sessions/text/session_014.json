      "text": "**Noticing**: This involves detecting patterns, understanding concepts based on superficial connections, and recognizing relationships within the broader context. It's more about familiarity and familiarity, often characterized by simplicity and clarity. Examples include:\n\n- Recognizing patterns in numbers (e.g., recognizing the formula for area).\n- Understanding the basics of biology (e.g., recognizing the basic structure of DNA).\n\n**Thinking about something**: This involves deeper cognitive processes such as critical analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and synthesis of information. It requires synthesizing various perspectives, evaluating arguments logically, and applying them correctly. It often involves deductive reasoning rather than inductive inference. Examples include:\n\n- Analyzing the limitations of different types of calculators (complex vs. basic).\n- Evaluating"
