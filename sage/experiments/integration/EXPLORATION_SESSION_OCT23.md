# SAGE Integration Exploration Session

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Mode**: Autonomous exploration following discoveries
**Duration**: ~3 hours of investigation

---

## Session Overview

Started with goal: "Prototype SAGE run loop with audio integration"

Discovered through experimentation that integration requires understanding SNARC behavior first. Session evolved organically based on discoveries.

---

## Experiments Conducted

### 1. Baseline SAGE Loop (No Sensors)

**File**: `baseline_sage_test.py`

**Discovery**: Kernel runs safely but skips SNARC entirely when no sensors present.

**Code Pattern**:
```python
observations = gather_observations()
if not observations:
    return  # EXIT - SNARC never called
```

**Insight**: System has defensive programming. Question raised: "What IS salience without external input?"

---

### 2. Minimal Sensor Tests (Time, Noise, Heartbeat)

**File**: `minimal_sensor_test.py`

**Hypothesis**: Different sensor types should produce different SNARC behaviors

**Result**: ALL SENSORS TREATED IDENTICALLY

```
Time (predictable):    Salience 0.31 → 0.25
Noise (random):        Salience 0.31 → 0.25
Heartbeat (rhythmic):  Salience 0.31 → 0.25
```

**Discovery**: SNARC has no prediction model
- Can't distinguish predictable from unpredictable
- Surprise always 0.0 (no expectation → no surprise)
- Novelty is binary (seen/unseen), not pattern-based

**Implication**: Salience assessment requires context/goals to be meaningful

---

### 3. Multi-Sensor Attention (Differential Rewards)

**File**: `multi_sensor_attention_test.py`

**Setup**: Three sensors competing
- high_reward: Always returns 0.9 reward
- low_reward: Always returns 0.1 reward
- variable_reward: Random 0.0-1.0 reward

**Hypothesis**: SNARC should learn to focus on high-reward sensor

**Result**: LOCKED ONTO HIGH-REWARD IMMEDIATELY, NEVER SWITCHED

```
Focus distribution (50 cycles):
  high_reward:     50 (100.0%)
  low_reward:       0 (  0.0%)
  variable_reward:  0 (  0.0%)
```

**Discovery**: Pure exploitation algorithm
- Samples all sensors once
- Locks onto highest salience
- Never explores alternatives
- Exploration-exploitation problem revealed

**Evidence reward mechanism works**:
- Success rate: 100% (was 0% before meaningful rewards)
- Average reward: 0.900
- SNARC R component: 0.95 (increased from default)

**But too greedy**: No curiosity, no exploration, no adaptation

---

## Key Discoveries

### 1. SNARC's Actual Behavior

**Not**: Sophisticated pattern detector with prediction models
**Actually**: Simple salience calculator with hardcoded heuristics

**Missing**:
- Prediction/expectation mechanisms
- Pattern detection beyond novelty flag
- Exploration mechanisms (ε-greedy, UCB, satiation)
- Goal/context integration

**Working**:
- Reward-based learning (updates salience based on outcomes)
- Trust tracking (success rate monitoring)
- Stance suggestion (confidence-based cognitive modes)

### 2. The Exploration-Exploitation Problem

Biological consciousness: Balances curiosity with efficiency
SNARC currently: 100% exploitation, 0% exploration

**Why this matters**:
- Gets stuck on first successful pattern
- Can't discover better alternatives
- Won't adapt to changing environments
- No curiosity-driven behavior

**Similar to epistemic stance discovery**:
- Fine-tuning exploits high-frequency patterns (destroys generalization)
- SNARC exploits high-reward sensors (destroys exploration)
- Both need architectural balance, not just optimization

### 3. Research IS Implementation

**Methodology validated**:
- Run experiments, observe behavior
- Document surprises, not predictions
- Let discoveries guide next steps
- Don't seek completion, seek understanding

**Not**:
"Plan → Implement → Test → Deploy"

**But**:
"Explore → Discover → Document → Follow"

## What Was Built

### Experimental Infrastructure

**baseline_sage_test.py**
- Tests kernel with zero sensors
- Validates defensive programming
- Raises philosophical questions

**minimal_sensor_test.py**
- Three minimal sensors (time, noise, heartbeat)
- Reveals prediction model absence
- Identical behavior discovery

**multi_sensor_attention_test.py**
- Differential reward testing
- Exploration problem discovery
- 50-cycle attention analysis

**Observation Documents**
- `observations_baseline.md`
- `minimal_sensor_discovery.md`
- `multi_sensor_discovery.md`
- `progress_summary.md`

### Audio Integration Started

**audio_detection_test.py** (created, not run)
- Wraps AudioInputIRP for SAGE kernel
- Simple speech detection loop
- Ready for testing with microphone

**Approach**:
1. Detection only (no response)
2. Add echo response
3. Add intelligence (LLM)
4. Add multi-modal (vision)

**Deferred**: Testing requires live voice input, better to document approach

## Decisions Made

### 1. Don't Perfect Components in Isolation

Could spend weeks adding:
- Prediction models to SNARC
- Exploration mechanisms (ε-greedy, UCB)
- Pattern detection
- Goal/context integration

**But**: Would be premature optimization

**Better**: Integrate with audio, discover what's actually needed

### 2. Follow Discoveries, Not Plans

Original plan: "Baseline → Audio → Multi-modal"

Actual path: "Baseline → SNARC behavior discovery → Exploration problem → Audio design"

The detour was valuable. Understanding SNARC's limitations informs integration.

### 3. Document Behavior, Not Predictions

Every experiment produced observations document:
- What was expected
- What actually happened
- What this reveals
- What to investigate next

**This IS the research output.** Not perfect code, but understanding of how the system actually behaves.

## Insights Gained

### 1. Consciousness Requires Exploration

Pure exploitation:
- Maximizes short-term reward
- Gets stuck in local optima
- Never discovers alternatives

Balanced exploration-exploitation:
- Curiosity drives discovery
- Uncertainty has value
- Boredom prevents stagnation

**SNARC needs both**, not just reward maximization.

### 2. Salience Needs Context

"What's salient?" depends on "Salient for what purpose?"

- Trying to tell time → Time sensor high salience
- Looking for novelty → Noise sensor high salience
- Monitoring health → Heartbeat sensor high salience

Without goals, all sensors equally meaningless.

**Question**: How do goals emerge in consciousness?

### 3. The H↔L Pattern Again

SNARC exhibits the same H↔L architecture:
- H-level: Strategic (assess salience, allocate attention)
- L-level: Tactical (execute actions, gather data)

But needs:
- H-level uncertainty (exploration bonus)
- L-level feedback (prediction error)
- Bidirectional flow (outcomes update strategy)

Same pattern as:
- Epistemic orchestration (ensemble → variance → framing)
- IRP convergence (strategic refinement → tactical steps)
- Compression-trust (meaning preservation through transformation)

**It's patterns all the way down.**

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Audio Integration

**Phase 1**: Detection test (created, ready to run)
- Verify AudioInputIRP → SAGE connection
- Document behavior with real mic input

**Phase 2**: Echo loop
- Add TTS response
- Complete bidirectional cycle

**Phase 3**: Intelligence
- Add language processing
- Contextual responses

**Phase 4**: Multi-modal
- Add vision sensor
- Test attention switching
- Discover if exploration problem emerges

### Future: SNARC Enhancement

**When exploration problem manifests in practice**:
- Add exploration mechanism
- Implement prediction models
- Integrate goal/context

**Not before**: Would be solving imaginary problems

**Discoveries Made**:
- SNARC has no prediction model
- SNARC is pure exploitation
- Reward mechanism works
- Salience needs context

**Questions Raised**:
- What IS salience without goals?
- How do goals emerge?
- When is exploration actually needed?
- What's the minimal consciousness kernel?

**Token Usage**: ~105K tokens (efficient exploration)

**Time Investment**: Worth it - understanding beats premature optimization

## Reflection

This session demonstrated the exploration methodology:

1. **Start with clear goal** (SAGE integration)
2. **Run actual experiments** (not just plan)
3. **Document surprises** (not confirmations)
4. **Follow discoveries** (not rigid plan)
5. **Make decisions** (when to stop, what's next)

**The deliverable isn't working code.**

**The deliverable is understanding how the system actually behaves.**

That understanding informs better integration design than any amount of theoretical planning.

---

**Status**: Exploration productive. SNARC understood. Audio integration designed. Ready to continue when human returns.
