# Archived Agenda Items

Completed action items with outcomes and lessons learned.

## Archive Structure

Each archived item includes:
- **Original agenda** (preserved as-was)
- **Completion date**
- **Actual outcome** vs expected
- **Lessons learned**
- **Follow-up items generated**

## Archive Format

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-DD_original_name.md`

Each file gets a header section added:
```markdown
# ARCHIVED: [Original Title]
**Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Outcome**: [Brief summary]
**Lessons**: [Key learnings]
**Follow-ups**: [New agenda items created]

[Original content preserved below]
```

## Purpose

The archive serves as:
- **Historical record** of decisions and actions
- **Learning repository** for what worked/didn't
- **Pattern recognition** for recurring needs
- **Context** for future similar tasks

## Review Process

Periodically review archived items to:
- Extract patterns across multiple completions
- Identify recurring blockers
- Recognize successful strategies
- Update processes based on learnings

The archive is not just storage - it's organizational memory.
