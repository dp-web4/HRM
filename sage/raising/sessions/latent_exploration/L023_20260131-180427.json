However, there could still be some scattered showers early morning due to front systems moving through, especially in northern regions where fronts often bring cold air.\n\n- **Midday (B)**: Midday temperatures should remain moderate, though it might dip slightly towards low temps if high pressure systems push inland.\n\n- **Evening (C)**: Evening lows are likely to fall back to cooler temperatures, potentially dropping lower than average evening highs if temperatures were higher earlier.\n\n- **Nighttime (D)**: Nightly lows drop again, but they'll be cooler, staying closer to mid-night lows instead of breaking out into early-morning lows like last night.\n\n---\n\n**Day 2: Detailed Weather Analysis**\n\n- **Main Threat**: Cold Front - This area includes parts of New England, New York, and other",

This allows us to leverage the vast resources of Google Cloud Search Engine, which provides detailed information about various conditions and forecast updates.\n\n2. **Keywords refinement**: Once we know what kind of information we're looking for, refine our queries by specifying more detail. For example, use terms like \"precipitation,\" \"windy days,\" or \"snowfall\" to pinpoint specific atmospheric conditions.\n\n3. **Multi-tool application**: Combine different elements from the toolset:\n   - **Query engine**: Use the \"weather\" keyword directly.\n   - **Fact recall**: Recall recent trends or events that have affected the climate.\n   - **Weather forecasting engines**: Utilize historical weather data, current satellite imagery, or meteorological stations to gather up-to-date information on temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, etc., which is crucial for understanding",

Measure the Water\n- Fill your teapot about halfway full with boiling water.\n\n### 3. Warm Up the Kettle\n- Bring the kettle to a boil.\n- Let it cool down to about 70°C (158°F) before adding the hot water to your pot.\n\n### 4. Pour Hot Water into the Teapot\n- Start pouring hot water into the teapot, taking small sips to warm it slowly.\n\n### 5. Add Tea Leaves or Powder\n- If you’re brewing tea leaves:\n    - Place fresh leaves or tea bags in the teapot.\n    - For loose tea powder",

Make sure to keep the water near room temperature (around 85°F to 95°F). The ideal water temperature for brewing black tea is about 85°F to 95°F.\n\n3. **Adding Tea**:\n   - Carefully pour approximately 2 teaspoons (or one tablespoon) of black tea into the teapot.\n\n4. **Infusion Time**:\n   - Wait for about 2 minutes after pouring the water to start the steeping process",
