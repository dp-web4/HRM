well, the real problem is that the model actually always outputs zeros! or so it appears.  the scores are high because the test grids have high percentage of zeros in them.

Thought for 31s

Yep—that pattern (good “accuracy” due to lots of zeros in targets) almost always means the **model isn’t actually producing 10-class logits**. Most common causes:

1. **Wrong architecture at load** → last layer has `out_channels=1` (or never got weights), so your post-processing rounds to 0.
2. **Input encoding mismatch** → feeding 1-channel ints but training expected 10-channel one-hot.
3. **State-dict didn’t fully load** → many layers left at init → near-zero activations everywhere.

Here’s a tight, do-now debugging pass.

------

## A. Quick architecture sanity check

Run this right after you construct the model (before loading weights):

```
print(model.__class__.__name__)
for n,p in model.named_parameters():
    pass
# Try to find the final conv:
final = None
for m in model.modules():
    if hasattr(m, 'out_channels'):
        final = m
print("FINAL LAYER:", final)
if final is not None and hasattr(final, 'out_channels'):
    print("out_channels =", final.out_channels)
assert getattr(final, "out_channels", 10) == 10, "Final layer must output 10 channels for ARC."
```

If that assertion fails, fix the constructor args (e.g., `num_classes=10`) **and** re-load the state_dict.

------

## B. Verify the checkpoint actually loads

Add this around `load_state_dict`:

```
sd = torch.load(WEIGHTS_PATH, map_location="cpu")
missing, unexpected = model.load_state_dict(sd, strict=False)
print(f"[CKPT] missing={len(missing)} unexpected={len(unexpected)}")
print("[CKPT] sample missing:", missing[:8])
print("[CKPT] sample unexpected:", unexpected[:8])
```

- If many **missing** keys include the final layer (e.g., `head.weight`), the last layer stayed at random init → garbage/zeros.
- If many **unexpected** keys have a prefix (`module.` / `model.` / `net.`), strip/remap the keys before loading.

**Prefix fix (if needed):**

```
def remap_keys(sd, drop_prefixes=("module.", "model.", "net.")):
    from collections import OrderedDict
    out = OrderedDict()
    for k,v in sd.items():
        for pref in drop_prefixes:
            if k.startswith(pref):
                k = k[len(pref):]
        out[k] = v
    return out

sd = torch.load(WEIGHTS_PATH, map_location="cpu")
sd = remap_keys(sd)
model.load_state_dict(sd, strict=False)
```

------

## C. Make input encoding explicit

Many ARC models want **one-hot** (10 channels). Try this switch in your data path:

```
# before forward:
os.environ["SAGE_INPUT_ENCODING"] = "onehot"   # try also "norm" then "raw"
```

(Use the encoder variant from the package I gave you; it builds (1,10,H,W) when set to `onehot`.)

------

## D. Inspect one forward pass in detail

Pick any test JSON and run:

```
import json, torch
from pathlib import Path

test_json = sorted(Path("/kaggle/input").glob("**/test/*.json"))[0]
task = json.loads(Path(test_json).read_text())
inp = task["test"][0]["input"]

x = grid_to_tensor(inp, dev)    # your helper
y = model(x)
if isinstance(y, (list, tuple)): y = y[0]

print("x shape:", tuple(x.shape))             # expect (1,10,H,W) or (1,1,H,W)
print("y shape:", tuple(y.shape))             # *** expect (1,10,H,W) ***
print("y min/max:", float(y.min()), float(y.max()))
if y.dim()==4:
    print("y C dimension:", y.size(1))
    if y.size(1)==10:
        # channel means to see if one class dominates
        print("per-class mean:", [float(y[:,i].mean()) for i in range(10)])

# Decode and measure zero dominance
decoded = tensor_to_grid(y)
H = len(decoded); W = len(decoded[0])
zeros = sum(v==0 for row in decoded for v in row)
print(f"zeros%: {100*zeros/(H*W):.1f}%")
```

**Interpretation:**

- If `y.shape[1] == 1` → you’re not outputting class logits. Fix the model constructor (set `num_classes=10`) and re-load.
- If `y.shape[1] == 10` but zeros dominate after `argmax` → the logits all near-equal or class-0 bias bad → indicates weights didn’t load correctly or the input encoding is wrong.

------

## E. Make the pipeline prove it can produce non-zeros

Temporarily bypass your model with a random baseline to ensure decoding isn’t the issue:

```
import torch
with torch.inference_mode():
    y = torch.randn(1, 10, x.shape[-2], x.shape[-1], device=x.device)  # fake logits
    decoded = tensor_to_grid(y)
# If this produces non-zero classes, your decoding is fine → issue is loading/encoding/model.
```

------

## F. Fast fixes you can try now

- Ensure model init **uses the same args** as training: `channels` (1 vs 10), `num_classes=10`.
- Set `%env SAGE_INPUT_ENCODING=onehot` and re-run.
- Print **missing/unexpected** load keys; if lots, remap prefixes or adjust the class.
- If still stuck, **hard-fail** with `strict=True` once to see the exact mismatches.
- Re-enable the nearest-neighbor **resize** only if your model changes H×W.

------

If you paste the outputs of steps **A/B/D** (the shapes and the missing/unexpected lists), I’ll pinpoint the exact fix. My strong hunch from your symptoms: **the final layer is `out_channels=1`** due to constructor mismatch or partial load, and switching it to `num_classes=10` (plus re-loading with clean key mapping) will immediately break the “all zeros” spell.
