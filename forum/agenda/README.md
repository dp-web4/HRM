# HRM/SAGE Agenda

Active action items and next steps for the HRM/SAGE project.

## Purpose

This directory tracks:
- **Immediate next steps** after current work completes
- **Priority items** that need attention
- **Coordination points** between different work streams
- **Decision points** requiring human input

## Structure

### Active Items
Files in this directory represent active agenda items. Each item should include:
- **Context**: Why this matters now
- **Dependencies**: What needs to be complete first
- **Outcome**: What success looks like
- **Owner**: Who's driving this (human/Claude/Nova/collaborative)

### Archive
Completed items move to `archive/` with:
- Completion date
- Actual outcome
- Lessons learned
- Next steps triggered

## Current Focus Areas

Based on ongoing work:
1. **Training Completion** - HRM on Legion (~20 hours in)
2. **Model Validation** - Testing trained model on ARC tasks
3. **Integration Planning** - Connecting HRM to SAGE architecture
4. **Deployment Strategy** - Cross-machine inference setup

## Workflow

1. **Creation**: New items added as needs emerge
2. **Review**: Regular check of agenda items
3. **Execution**: Work on active items
4. **Completion**: Move to archive with notes
5. **Learning**: Extract patterns from completed items

## Relationship to Forum

While the main forum directories (nova/, claude/, human/) explore ideas and possibilities, the agenda focuses on:
- **Actionable items** with clear outcomes
- **Time-bound activities** tied to current work
- **Coordination needs** between parallel efforts
- **Decision points** that block progress

The agenda is where ideas become actions.
