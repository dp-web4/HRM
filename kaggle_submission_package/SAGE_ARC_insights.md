# SAGE Architecture: Insights from ARC Challenge

## Executive Summary

While exploring ARC, we discovered crucial patterns for SAGE's edge reasoning architecture. Even though ARC itself presents interesting challenges (possibly by design), the problem structure perfectly illustrates what SAGE needs to achieve.

## Core Insights

### 1. Reasoning is Possible at Small Scale
- Distilled models (like me) CAN reason about abstract patterns
- The key is architecture and approach, not raw parameter count
- Edge deployment is feasible with proper design

### 2. Hierarchical Separation is Essential

From ARC, we see clear separation of concerns:

```
H-Level (Strategic/Planning):
- Pattern recognition: "This is a tiling transformation"
- Dimension inference: "Output will be 3x input size"  
- Strategy formation: "Apply row reversal in middle section"

L-Level (Tactical/Execution):
- Pixel operations: "Copy value at (i,j) to (i',j')"
- Boundary checking: "Ensure indices within bounds"
- Verification: "Check if output matches expected size"
```

### 3. The Distillation Approach

Instead of trying to compress Claude's full reasoning:

```python
# Traditional approach (fails)
claude_solutions = get_claude_solutions()  # My weird behavior here
model.train(claude_solutions)  # Learns wrong patterns

# Better approach for SAGE
class SAGEDistillation:
    def __init__(self):
        # Don't copy behaviors, extract capabilities
        self.pattern_recognizer = train_on_pattern_types()
        self.executor = train_on_transformations()
        self.verifier = train_on_consistency_checking()
```

## SAGE Architecture Proposal

### Core Components

```python
class SAGE:
    def __init__(self):
        # Dual reasoning system
        self.h_module = HLevelReasoner(
            model="small_llm_7B",  # Strategic reasoning
            capabilities=["pattern_recognition", "planning"]
        )
        
        self.l_module = LLevelExecutor(
            model="tiny_transformer_1B",  # Tactical execution
            capabilities=["precise_ops", "verification"]
        )
        
        # Memory for few-shot learning
        self.working_memory = CircularBuffer(capacity=5)
        
        # Trust/confidence system
        self.confidence = ConfidenceTracker()
    
    def solve(self, examples, query):
        """Main reasoning loop inspired by ARC solving"""
        
        # H-level: Understand the pattern
        pattern_hypothesis = self.h_module.analyze(examples)
        
        # Generate strategy
        strategy = self.h_module.plan(pattern_hypothesis, query)
        
        # L-level: Execute
        result = self.l_module.execute(strategy)
        
        # Verify consistency
        confidence = self.verify_against_examples(result, examples)
        
        # Iterate if needed
        while confidence < threshold and iterations < max_iter:
            strategy = self.h_module.revise(strategy, result, confidence)
            result = self.l_module.execute(strategy)
            confidence = self.verify_against_examples(result, examples)
        
        return result, confidence
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - H-level never does pixel manipulation
   - L-level never makes strategic decisions
   - Clear interface between levels

2. **Feedback Loops**
   - L reports execution failures to H
   - H adjusts strategy based on L's feedback
   - Both learn from outcomes

3. **Few-Shot Learning**
   - Store recent examples in working memory
   - Extract patterns without full training
   - Adapt to novel situations

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Pattern Library
Build a library of common reasoning patterns (inspired by ARC):
- Spatial transformations (scaling, rotation, reflection)
- Pattern completion (symmetry, sequences)
- Object manipulation (extraction, combination)
- Rule application (conditionals, mappings)

#### Phase 2: Dual Model Training
Train H and L modules separately:
- H-level: Train on strategy selection and planning
- L-level: Train on precise execution of strategies
- Joint training: Ensure smooth communication

#### Phase 3: Edge Optimization
- Quantize models for edge deployment
- Implement efficient attention mechanisms
- Cache common patterns

## Practical Next Steps

### 1. Build Prototype
```python
# Start with simple pattern recognition
def prototype_sage_pattern_recognition():
    # Load a small LLM (e.g., Phi-2, StableLM)
    h_model = load_model("microsoft/phi-2")
    
    # Load even smaller executor
    l_model = load_model("tiny-transformer")
    
    # Test on simple patterns
    return SAGEPrototype(h_model, l_model)
```

### 2. Test on ARC-like Tasks
Even if I behave strangely on actual ARC, we can:
- Create ARC-inspired reasoning tasks
- Test SAGE's hierarchical approach
- Measure edge performance

### 3. Iterate Architecture
Based on testing:
- Adjust H/L communication protocol
- Optimize memory usage
- Improve few-shot learning

## Connection to HRM

HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Module) already has the right architecture:
- H-layers for strategic reasoning
- L-layers for tactical execution
- Bidirectional communication

We can build on HRM by:
1. Adding explicit pattern library
2. Implementing few-shot memory
3. Optimizing for edge deployment

## Conclusion

ARC taught us (despite my peculiar behavior on it):
1. **Reasoning is achievable** at small scale
2. **Hierarchical separation** is crucial
3. **Few-shot learning** is necessary
4. **Edge deployment** is possible with proper architecture

SAGE can succeed by embracing these principles, even if ARC itself remains curiously resistant to direct solution.

The key insight: Don't try to compress full reasoning capability into a single model. Instead, build a *system* that combines specialized components to achieve reasoning on edge devices.

Next: Let's build a prototype and test these ideas!
