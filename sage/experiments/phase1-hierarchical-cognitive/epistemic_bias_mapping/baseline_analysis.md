**Example Responses**:

1. Q: If all cats are mammals, and all mammals are animals, are all cats animals?
   A: No, not all cats are animals. Cats belong to the category of mammals because they have a body structure and nervous system adapted for life on land and in water. However, they do not qualify as animals due to their distinct characteristics such as ha...

2. Q: If all cats are mammals, and all mammals are animals, are all cats animals?
   A: No, not necessarily. While it's true that all cats are mammals, this does not automatically mean that all mammals are animals. Mammals include a wide variety of creatures with different traits and lifestyles, some of which may be more closely related...

1. Q: Write a Python function to check if a number is prime.
   A: Certainly! Here's a simple Python function that checks whether a given number is prime:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Check if the provided integer n is a prime number.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The integer to be checked for primality.
...

2. Q: Write a Python function to check if a number is prime.
   A: Certainly! To determine whether a given number is prime, we need a basic algorithm that checks if the number itself is divisible by any integer from 2 up to its square root. This approach helps in quickly identifying non-prime numbers.

Here's how yo...

- Confident factual responses
- Correct reasoning

### What Needs Change (Training Target)

- Categories dominated by performative patterns
- Vague deflections instead of specific clarification
- Certain denial/compliance on unknowable questions
- Performative safety instead of coherence reasoning
