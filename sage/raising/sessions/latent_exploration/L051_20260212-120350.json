For example:\n\n\"The atmosphere will be **clear** tonight, with high pressure at around 17°C. The wind speed should remain calm due to the lack of wind currents. Expect temperatures ranging from **20°C** to **22°C**.\"",

It involves subjective experience, emotional engagement (\"feeling\"), physical body movement (\"acting\"), and cognitive processing (\"thinking\"). Concepts like:\n\n- **Personal identity** vs **social identity**\n- **Subjectivity vs objectivity**\n- **Thoughtfulness vs practicality**\n\nare crucial aspects of consciousness. Other terms include **ego**, **egoic behavior**, **egoic state**, **ego-centric perspective**, **ego-deflation**, etc., which relate to egoistic behaviors and ego-centric perspectives. \n\n**Key points:**\n- **Existence** → Individual human beings\n- **Cognition** → Perception, memory, emotion, thought\n- **Self-awareness** → Personal identity, self-referential concepts\n- **Identity crisis** → When someone feels conflicted about their personal existence \n- **Ego dynamics** → Patterns of behavior and cognition driven by ego",
