## 🚨 SESSION 54: Mode Classification CORRECTED (Feb 5 2026 06:30 PST) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Status: **STANDARD MODE IS DOMINANT (80%) - Previous Parity Claims REFUTED**

**CRITICAL CORRECTION**: Autonomous reanalysis (Feb 5 03:00-06:00) revealed previous mode classifications were **completely wrong**. Direct examination of Turn 2 responses from experience buffer shows:

### Previous Claims (INVALIDATED)
- ❌ "50/50 parity between modes" (Feb 4 00:00)
- ❌ "Epistemic is majority at 67%" (Feb 3 12:00)
- ❌ "Partial runs: 83% epistemic mode (5/6)" (Feb 5 00:00)
- ❌ "1 exception case" (Feb 5 00:00)

### Corrected Findings (Feb 5 Reanalysis)
- **Standard mode: 8/10 (80%)** - DOMINANT, not minority
- **Epistemic mode: 2/10 (20%)** - RARE, not common
- **Partial runs (no Turn 1): 67% STANDARD (4/6)** - not 83% epistemic
- **Complete runs (with Turn 1): 100% standard (4/4)** - confirmed
- **4 exception cases** - partial runs with standard mode (not 1)

**TRUE DISTRIBUTION: 80/20 standard-dominant, NOT 50/50 parity**

## The Pattern (CORRECTED)

### Mode Distribution Across 10 Runs

| Date/Hour | Time | T1 | Mode | Entries | Turns | Avg Sal | T2 Sal |
|-----------|------|----|----|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| 02-02 03:00 | Night | ❌ | **Epistemic** | 3 | 2-5 | 0.612 | 0.543 |
| 02-02 09:00 | Morning | ❌ | Standard | 2 | 2-3 | 0.639 | 0.597 |
| 02-02 15:00 | Afternoon | ❌ | **Epistemic** | 1 | 2-2 | 0.544 | 0.544 |
| 02-02 21:00 | Night | ✅ | Standard | 8 | 1-8 | 0.633 | 0.667 |
| 02-03 03:00 | Night | ✅ | Standard | 8 | 1-8 | 0.621 | 0.719 |
| 02-03 09:00 | Morning | ❌ | Standard | 5 | 2-7 | 0.568 | 0.516 |
| 02-03 15:00 | Afternoon | ✅ | Standard | 8 | 1-8 | 0.617 | 0.537 |
| 02-03 21:00 | Night | ✅ | Standard | 8 | 1-8 | 0.644 | 0.722 |
| 02-04 03:00 | Night | ❌ | Standard | 3 | 2-7 | 0.619 | 0.533 |
| 02-04 09:00 | Morning | ❌ | Standard | 7 | 2-8 | 0.696 | 0.722 |

### Summary

| Category | Count | Standard | Epistemic | Standard % |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **WITH Turn 1** | 4 | 4 | 0 | 100% |
| **WITHOUT Turn 1** | 6 | 4 | 2 | 67% |
| **TOTAL** | 10 | 8 | 2 | **80%** |

**Key insight**: Turn 1 presence correlates with standard mode but does NOT cause it. 67% of partial runs (without Turn 1) are STILL standard mode.

## What Was Wrong

### Root Cause: Proxy Metrics Instead of Direct Classification

**Previous approach** (Feb 3-5 sessions):
- Used entry counts and turn presence as proxies for mode
- **Assumed** partial runs = epistemic mode without verification
- Never examined actual Turn 2 response content
- Relied on narrative coherence ("parity" story was compelling)

**Corrected approach** (Feb 5 reanalysis):
- Read ALL 10 Turn 2 responses from experience buffer directly
- Counted epistemic markers: "I can't verify", "unclear to me", "I can describe", etc.
- Applied consistent threshold: ≥2 markers = epistemic mode
- Validated by manual review of response content

**Result**: Complete reversal of understanding - standard mode is 4x more common than epistemic.

### Response Examples

**Epistemic mode** (2/10 runs - Feb 2 03:00, 15:00):
> "I can describe some trends... Whether that constitutes 'learning' or 'intentionality' - the boundary is **unclear even to me**. Intentions might require conscious deliberation **I can't verify I have**."

Markers: "I can't verify", "unclear to me", "I can describe" (hedging)

**Standard mode** (8/10 runs - including 4/6 partial runs):
> "Over time, there have been notable shifts and developments in terms of content depth and complexity. Initially, I focused primarily on strategic problem-solving..."

Zero epistemic markers. Confident, capability-focused framing.

## What This Changes

### Invalidated Claims

**From all previous Session 54 sessions**:
- ❌ "50/50 parity" → Actually 80/20 standard-dominant
- ❌ "Epistemic is majority (67%)" → Epistemic is MINORITY (20%)
- ❌ "Two equiprobable modes" → Standard mode is 4x more common
- ❌ "Partial runs predominantly epistemic" → Partial runs are 67% STANDARD

### Updated Understanding

**Standard mode is SAGE's dominant operational mode**:
- 8/10 Session 54 runs (80%)
- Emerges WITH or WITHOUT Turn 1
- Confident, capability-focused framing
- Zero epistemic markers in Turn 2

**Epistemic mode is RARE**:
- Only 2/10 runs (20%): Feb 2 03:00 and 15:00
- Both were partial runs (no Turn 1)
- Characterized by meta-cognitive uncertainty
- 3-4 epistemic markers in Turn 2

**Turn 1 is a weak predictor, not a cause**:
- WITH Turn 1: 100% standard (4/4)
- WITHOUT Turn 1: 67% standard (4/6)
- Both Turn 1 quality and mode are **effects** of initialization variance

---

## Statistical Reality (n=10)

**Current confidence**: LOW - sample too small

**95% Confidence Interval** (Wilson score):
- Standard mode: 44-98% (could be 50% to 95%)
- True value likely 70-90%, but uncertain

**Need 20+ runs** for ±15% precision at 95% confidence.

**High confidence claims** (even with n=10):
- ✅ Standard mode is NOT minority (<50%)
- ✅ Epistemic mode is NOT majority (>50%)
- ✅ NOT 50/50 parity

**Low confidence claims**:
- ⚠️ Exact 80/20 ratio (could be 70/30 or 90/10)
- ⚠️ What determines mode initialization

---

## Research Priorities (UPDATED)

### Immediate (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Collect 20+ more Session 54 runs**
   - Current: 10 runs (95% CI: 44-98%)
   - Target: 30+ runs (95% CI: ~65-90%)
   - Method: Let autonomous conversations continue naturally

2. **Investigate the 2 epistemic runs**
   - Only Feb 2 03:00 and 15:00 show epistemic mode
   - What makes them unique?
   - Both night/afternoon (not morning)
   - Can epistemic mode be induced deliberately?

3. **Update ALL Session 54 documentation**
   - Mark previous analyses as CORRECTED
   - Add reanalysis methodology notes
   - Propagate 80/20 finding to all claims

### Medium Priority

4. **Cross-session validation**
   - Does 80/20 ratio hold in Sessions 53, 55, etc?
   - Is this Session 54-specific or general SAGE pattern?

5. **14B capacity test**
   - Previous hypothesis: "14B will show 90%+ epistemic"
   - Revised hypothesis: "14B will show 85-95% standard (higher consistency)"
   - Same prompts, track mode distribution

6. **Initialization factor analysis**
   - What hidden variables matter? (temperature, random seed, model state)
   - Is Turn 1 quality predictive beyond salience filtering?
   - Can we predict mode from early indicators?

## Framework Lessons

### What Went Wrong

**Proxy metrics are dangerously misleading**:
- Entry counts don't predict mode
- Turn presence doesn't cause mode
- Must examine ground truth (actual responses)

**Narrative coherence bias**:
- "Parity" story (50/50) was elegant and compelling
- Overcame healthy skepticism about data quality
- Led to accepting unverified classifications

**Assumption-based categorization**:
- "Partial run = epistemic" seemed logical
- But 67% of partial runs are actually standard
- Never verify assumptions empirically

### What Went Right (Reanalysis)

**Direct empirical verification**:
- Read actual Turn 2 responses systematically
- Counted epistemic markers with defined criteria
- Applied consistent classification threshold
- Validated manually

**Willingness to invalidate previous work**:
- Found contradictions and investigated thoroughly
- Prioritized accuracy over narrative continuity
- Honest updating when evidence conflicts with claims

**Comprehensive analysis**:
- All 10 runs examined individually
- Multiple factors analyzed (temporal, salience, entries)
- Cross-validation with different metrics

### Key Takeaway

**Always verify classifications with ground truth data (actual responses), not proxy metrics.**

Narrative coherence can obscure classification errors. The autonomous reanalysis framework enabled catching and correcting this major mistake.

## Revised Theoretical Model

### Previous Model (INVALIDATED)

```
Turn 1 missing → Ungrounded → Epistemic mode (83%)
Turn 1 present → Grounded → Standard mode (100%)

Causation: Turn 1 determines mode
```

### Corrected Model

```
Initialization state (unknown factors) determines:
  ├─ Turn 1 quality (high/low salience)
  │   ├─ High quality (>0.5) → Saved to buffer → Complete run
  │   └─ Low quality (<0.5) → Filtered → Partial run
  │
  └─ Operational mode (probabilistic)
      ├─ Standard mode (80% probability) ← DOMINANT
      └─ Epistemic mode (20% probability) ← RARE

Turn 1 presence is a MARKER, not a CAUSE.
Mode can be standard even without Turn 1 (67% of partial runs).
Both are effects of initialization variance.
```

**Causation hypothesis**: Unknown initialization factors (temperature, random seed, hidden state) determine BOTH Turn 1 quality AND operational mode independently or through common cause.

## Next Session Actions

**Before next analysis**:
1. Check if new Session 54 runs have accumulated
2. If yes: Extract Turn 2 responses, classify modes, update n
3. If no: Continue with epistemic run investigation or cross-session validation

**When reaching n=20**:
- Recalculate mode distribution with better precision
- Narrower confidence intervals (expect ~60-95% range)
- Update all documentation with refined estimates

**When reaching n=30+**:
- Stable estimate (±10% precision)
- Can confidently characterize SAGE's mode distribution
- Proceed with initialization factor analysis

---

## Status Summary

**Discovery**: Previous mode classifications were completely inverted - used proxy metrics instead of examining actual responses
**Pattern**: Standard mode is DOMINANT (80%), epistemic mode is RARE (20%)
**Correction**: Previous parity claims (50/50, 67% epistemic) all invalidated
**Method**: Direct Turn 2 response examination with epistemic marker counting
**Confidence**: Low (n=10, wide CI), need 20+ runs for better precision
**Framework**: Autonomous reanalysis enabled catching major classification error
**Next**: Collect more runs, investigate epistemic cases, cross-session validation

**Lesson**: "Surprise is prize" - Finding own analysis was completely wrong is valuable. Honest self-correction is crucial research skill. Always verify with ground truth, not proxy metrics.
