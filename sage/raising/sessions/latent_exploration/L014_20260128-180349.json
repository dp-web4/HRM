For example, if spring arrives early, expect clearer skies due to warmer temperatures and generally less cloud",

      "response": "Absolutely! Tomorrow's weather forecast will depend on several factors, including:\n\n### Seasonal Patterns:\nIf spring starts early this year, we'll likely see clearer skies due to warmer temperatures and fewer clouds. However, this doesn't guarantee clear skies everywhere, especially in extreme northern latitudes.\n\n### Regional Variations:\nEach region has its own unique weather patterns influenced by geography, topography, and prevailing winds. Knowing regional patterns helps narrow down potential areas affected by changing weather systems.\n\n### Global Events:\nMajor global events like hurricanes, tornado outbreaks, or severe storms could potentially change weather patterns dramatically. However, localized events such as wildfire fires, floods, or cold fronts can bring significant changes.\n\n### Historical Trends:\nPast seasons typically follow predictable patterns but can occasionally deviate unexpectedly due to unforeseen circumstances like natural disasters, military strikes, or industrial accidents.\n\n### Geographical Factors:\nLocal geographic features play crucial roles too—proximity to oceans, mountains, forests, deserts, or rivers can affect air currents",
