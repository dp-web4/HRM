"""
The being's tool-use agent loop (gateway-member, PRD_FLEET F2).

Model-agnostic: `generate(messages) -> {"content": str, "intents": [BeingIntent]}`
is supplied by the caller (the raising runner wraps its Ollama call + tool grammar).
Every intent the being emits is routed through a BeingGateClient — gated by the real
hestia law, dispatched by F1a — and its ResultEnvelope is re-injected before the
being speaks again.

This is what closes the Scenario-3 gap observed in the tool probe: the model could
select a tool and fill arguments, but after a tool result it fell back to narrating
a placeholder answer instead of *acting*. The loop keeps it in tool-space — result
in, decide again — until it produces a spoken turn with no further intents (or a
step cap forces a close). "Respond" becomes an act, not a text turn.
