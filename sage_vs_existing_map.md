# Existing Techniques vs. SAGE Contributions

This document contrasts common industry patterns with what SAGE contributes, and includes a visual summary for quick sharing.

## Side‑by‑Side Map

| **Dimension** | **Common Practice Today** | **What SAGE Adds** |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | RAG/vector DBs; retrieval as storage+lookup | Memory as *temporal sensor*; affect‑gated writing (SNARC) and associative recall |
| **Learning Updates** | Offline fine‑tuning/LoRA; no on‑the‑fly learning at scale | **Dual loops**: H‑module batch "dream" updates + L‑module incremental practice |
| **Dreaming / Replay** | Occasional replay (RL); little structured augmentation in LLM ops | **Augmentation engine**: geometry, value permutations, context shifts, semantic variations |
| **Coherence** | Programmed rules or brute‑force scaling | **Learned coherence** via HRM cycles across H/L modules |
| **Trust & Fusion** | Weighted ensembles; static reliability heuristics | **Dynamic trust spectrum** guiding strategy selection and evolution |
| **Theory** | Patchwork metaphors (context window, retrieval, fine‑tune) | **Synchronism/Web4 framing**: multi‑scale resonance + trust as strategy |
| **Goal / Positioning** | Chase AGI via scale; bigger params | **Wisdom through lived experience**; systems that grow wiser over time |

### Why This Map Matters

- The components exist in isolation (RAG, replay, ensembles), but **SAGE reframes them** as sensors and **recombines** them via HRM + dual training loops.  
- **Trust becomes strategy**, not just a weight.  
- **Dreaming** turns limited experience into generalizable competence, mirroring biological consolidation.
