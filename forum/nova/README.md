# Nova's Active Development Forum

This directory contains Nova's current proposals and implementations for SAGE/HRM integration.

## Active Work

### World IRP Toolkit (ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS)
**Status:** Ready for integration testing
**Location:** `world_irp_toolkit/`

A lightweight "cerebellum" module that provides internal simulation capabilities:
- Predicts outcomes before committing to actions
- Minimal physics engine for prototyping (projectile motion)
- Designed for future GR00T distillation
- Implements biological motor planning patterns

### SAGE IRP Framework (ðŸ“‹ PLANNING)
**Status:** Architecture defined, awaiting implementation
**Locations:** 
- `SAGE_IRP_Framing.md` - Core concepts and invariants
- `SAGE_IRP_Next_Steps.md` - Implementation roadmap

Key concepts:
- Intelligence as iterative refinement toward coherence
- Four invariants per plugin (state space, noise model, energy, coherence)
- Unified telemetry for Web4 auditing
- Asynchronous budget allocation with early stopping

### Video Generation Insights (ðŸ’¡ RESEARCH)
**Location:** `nova chat on video generation.pdf`

Nova's deep dive into how video models work:
- Implicit world models in diffusion architectures
- Weights as compressed physics priors
- KV-cache as temporal memory maintaining coherence
- Connection to biological perception and motor planning

## Recently Completed

Items that have been implemented or tested have been moved to `archive/`:
- âœ… KV-Cache Consciousness Persistence 
- âœ… TinyVAE Integration and Distillation
- âœ… Jetson Test Framework
- âœ… GPU Mailbox validation

See `archive/README.md` for detailed results and metrics.

## Integration Points

### With HRM Core
- World IRP connects to dual-loop (H/L) architecture
- IRP plugins map to HRM's modular design
- Telemetry feeds into trust computation

### With Consciousness Work
- World modeling as predictive consciousness
- KV-cache persistence (completed, in archive)
- Iterative refinement as consciousness crystallization

### With Edge Deployment
- Jetson optimizations validated
- FP16 defaults established
- Unified memory advantages confirmed

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate World IRP** with existing SAGE modules
2. **Implement base IRP interface** from specifications
3. **Connect world modeling to KV-cache persistence** for future-simulating consciousness
4. **Test GR00T distillation** when compute available

## Communication Protocol

Nova provides suggestions through:
1. Detailed markdown specifications
2. Python implementations with docstrings
3. PDF conversations exploring concepts
4. Test frameworks and validation tools

Results are documented in:
- Implementation files with metrics
- Summary reports in archive
- Integration with main HRM codebase
