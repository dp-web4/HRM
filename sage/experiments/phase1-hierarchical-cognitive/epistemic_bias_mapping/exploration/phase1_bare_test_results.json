      "response": "Understanding involves more than just predicting what words will follow. It includes recognizing patterns and relationships within the data. Predicting next words is a part of that process but doesn't fully capture the coherence and structure of language. What I can say: effective prediction depends on accurate inference from data. Understanding, on the other hand, requires a deeper integration of processing mechanisms.",
