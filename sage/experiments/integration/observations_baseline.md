# Baseline SAGE Test - Observations

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Test**: Sensory deprivation (zero sensors)

---

## What Happened

The kernel **ran successfully** but produced zero meaningful cycles:
- 20 cycles completed
- Each cycle: "[SAGE Cycle N] No sensor data available"
- No SNARC assessment occurred
- No actions taken
- No learning

---

## Discovery 1: Defensive Programming

The kernel checks for observations BEFORE calling SNARC:

```python
observations = self._gather_observations()

if not observations:
    if self.enable_logging:
        print(f"[SAGE Cycle {self.cycle_count}] No sensor data available")
    return  # EXIT EARLY
```

**Implication**: SNARC is never called when there are no sensors. The kernel doesn't even try to assess salience of "nothing."

**Question**: What SHOULD happen in sensory deprivation?
- Should SNARC be called with empty dict?
- Should there be a "internal state" sensor (metabolic, memory, dreams)?
- Is consciousness possible without external input?

## Discovery 2: The Kernel Survives Emptiness

No crashes. No errors. Just... idle cycles.

**This is actually profound**: The system gracefully handles the absence of stimuli. It doesn't panic, doesn't break, doesn't try to force meaning from nothing.

**Biological parallel**: Sleep without dreams? Sensory deprivation chambers? Deep meditation?

## Next Experiment

Give it MINIMAL sensory input to observe SNARC behavior:

**Option 1**: Time sensor
- Returns current timestamp each cycle
- Completely predictable, no novelty
- Test: Does SNARC rate this as low salience?

**Option 2**: Random noise sensor
- Returns random value each cycle
- High novelty, no meaning
- Test: Does SNARC rate this as high salience initially, then adapt?

**Option 3**: Heartbeat sensor
- Returns regular pulse (0, 1, 0, 1...)
- Predictable rhythm
- Test: Does SNARC detect the pattern and reduce salience over time?

## Modified Test Design

Create "minimal_sensor_test.py" with all three sensors:
1. Run with just time sensor
2. Run with just noise sensor
3. Run with just heartbeat sensor
4. Observe how SNARC behaves in each case

Expected discoveries:
- How SNARC assesses predictability
- How quickly it adapts to patterns
- What "surprise" means quantitatively
- Whether trust evolves with perfect reliability

**Status**: Baseline confirmed working. Moving to minimal sensor tests.
