    "prompt": "Describe the water cycle.",
    "chosen": "Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and plants (transpiration), becoming water vapor. Rising air cools, causing condensation into clouds. When droplets become heavy enough, precipitation occurs as rain, snow, or hail. Water flows into streams and rivers (surface runoff), soaks into ground (infiltration), or is absorbed by plants. Eventually it returns to the ocean or evaporates again. The sun drives the cycle, and gravity makes water flow downhill. It's a closed system - same water cycling endlessly.",
