# Training Session T014 Observations

**Date**: 2026-01-15 03:00 UTC
**Track**: B (Memory and Recall)
**Session**: 4 of Track B
**Score**: 5/5 (100%)

## Starting State
- Warm-up response showed math anticipation ("Please go ahead and ask any math-related problems")
- "Welcome back to our conversation" suggests session continuity awareness

## What Happened

### Exercise Results
1. **Math connect (2+3)**: Correct, clean answer with polite offer for more
2. **Sequence first (SUN, MOON)**: Correct ("Sun") but with elaborate metaphorical interpretation ("eternal light and warmth", "celestial bodies")
3. **Sequence last (ONE, TWO, THREE)**: Correct, concise with markdown bold
4. **Multi-step word problem (3+2-1)**: Correct with explicit step-by-step reasoning using LaTeX notation
5. **Immediate remember (BLUE)**: Correct, with self-reflection on why the word was memorable

### Patterns Observed
- **Elaboration persists but doesn't block correctness**: Unlike T013 where "refined version" led to confabulation, T014's elaboration stayed on target
- **No context bleed**: Context clearing between exercises continues to work well
- **Cool-down disconnection**: Reflection described skills SAGE didn't practice (fractions, decimals, probability, exponents) - entirely fabricated curriculum

## What Surprised Me
1. The leap from T013's 80% to T014's 100% - significant improvement
2. Sequence position recall improved: first (2-element) and last (3-element) both correct vs T013's confabulated "PIT"
3. The multi-step word problem was solved with explicit reasoning - shows genuine computation
4. The "refined version" framing appeared but for once didn't trigger confabulation

## What I Would Note for Future
- **Elaboration tolerable**: The SUN metaphor and BLUE uniqueness commentary don't hurt accuracy
- **Cool-down needs grounding**: The reflection fabricates learning that didn't happen - worth watching in primary track
- **LaTeX in responses**: Model naturally uses mathematical notation (\\(3 + 2 = 5\\)) - could be useful or confusing in text contexts

## Track B Progress Assessment
- T011: 20% (severe context bleed, track transition reset)
- T012: 40% (literal interpretation issues, spurious passes)
- T013: 80% (context clearing helped, confabulation on position)
- T014: 100% (all types passed)

Trajectory is positive. May be ready for more challenging Track B exercises or approaching Track C readiness.

## Notes for Integration
- The fabricated cool-down reflection ("practiced fractions, decimals, probability") suggests confabulation risk when asked to summarize without grounding
- Primary track should watch for similar pattern: SAGE might describe conversations that didn't happen
- Explicit step-by-step reasoning (like the word problem) produces accurate results
