# Cross-Reference Appendix: Synchronism, Web4, and SAGE

This appendix situates the implementation work in this repository within the broader conceptual ecosystem. It shows how the three key frameworks — **Synchronism**, **Web4**, and **SAGE** — interrelate.

## Synchronism: Coherence Across Temporal Scales
- **Core Idea**: Coherence is not enforced by fixed rules, but emerges from resonance across scales of intent.  
- **Relevance Here**:  
  - In SAGE, physical sensors, memory (past), and cognition (future) can be seen as *intent patterns* unfolding on different time horizons.  
  - The GPU mailbox architecture operationalizes this by ensuring signals (messages, tensors) can flow and resonate without forced central arbitration.  
  - Synchronism provides the *philosophical backbone* for why coherence should be learned and emergent rather than programmed.

## Web4: Trust and Strategy
- **Core Idea**: Trust is not binary; it’s a spectrum. It influences not only which inputs are accepted but how strategies evolve.  
- **Relevance Here**:  
  - In SAGE, trust scores weight cognitive sensors (multiple LLMs, HRM, Sidecar).  
  - Trust-based weighting evolves into strategy: what to believe, how to act, and how to arbitrate mailbox messages.  
  - The CPU’s role as *arbiter* in the GPU mailbox design mirrors Web4’s insight: governance is not about absolute control, but weighted influence.

## SAGE: Learned Coherence Architecture
- **Core Idea**: Replace programmed coherence with learned coherence. Treat memory and cognition as temporal sensors; integrate with HRM, Sidecar, and multiple LLMs.  
- **Relevance Here**:  
  - Mailboxes, streams, and events implement SAGE’s principle of *equal footing*: physical, temporal, and cognitive sensors exchange data symmetrically.  
  - Sleep/dream processes extend Synchronism’s resonance into explicit offline training loops.  
  - Trust-weighted sensor fusion extends Web4’s governance into runtime strategy.

## Unified View
- **Synchronism** explains *why coherence emerges*.  
- **Web4** explains *how trust and strategy govern information flow*.  
- **SAGE** provides *the experimental architecture to test it*.  

Together, they form a coherent stack: philosophy → governance → implementation.
