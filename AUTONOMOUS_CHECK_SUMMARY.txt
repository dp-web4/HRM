SESSION #29: USER ACTIVITY DETECTED & SYSTEM STATUS
================================================================================

Timeline:
- 21:06 - Session start (autonomous check)
- 21:08 - System health verified, Track 3 tests validated
- 21:10 - Detected user commits (merge + documentation)
- 21:12 - Reviewed epistemic proprioception integration guidance
- 21:15 - Worklog updated with findings
- 21:20 - Session summary complete

KEY FINDING: USER ACTIVITY
===========================

User has been actively working on the repository:

**Merge Commit (9770c35):**
- Merged remote branch changes
- Integrated user's documentation work

**User Commit (dc332dc):**
- Archive ARC-AGI competition materials to archive/arc-agi/
- Update README with current status (Track 3 complete)
- Add epistemic proprioception integration guidance
- Document lessons learned from ARC-AGI work

**User's Key Insight:**
"ARC-AGI tangent taught valuable lesson: SAGE is attention orchestrator,
not task-solver. Epistemic proprioception enables trust by tracking what
we know vs infer vs guess."

NEW DOCUMENTATION: EPISTEMIC PROPRIOCEPTION
===========================================

File: sage/docs/EPISTEMIC_PROPRIOCEPTION_INTEGRATION.md

**The Proprioception Progression:**

Three independent emergences of proprioception concepts:

1. **Physical Proprioception** (SAGE)
   - "Where are my limbs?"
   - Body position in physical space
   - Essential for: Movement, coordination, embodied action
   - Status: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

2. **Linguistic Proprioception** (Emerging)
   - "What's the gap between thought and words?"
   - Translation between representations
   - Essential for: Communication, cross-modal understanding, VAE compression

3. **Epistemic Proprioception** (NEW)
   - "What do I actually know vs pattern-match?"
   - Knowledge position in epistemic space
   - Essential for: Trust calibration, uncertainty tracking, honest reasoning

**Core Principle:**
"Consciousness requires knowing the boundaries of your own knowledge.
Epistemic proprioception is meta-awareness—the consciousness kernel
knowing its own state."

**Why This Matters for SAGE:**
- Embodied agents must know when to defer, explore, or act
- SNARC salience scoring requires confidence assessment
- IRP convergence must distinguish "converged to truth" from "stuck in local minimum"
- Metabolic state transitions require epistemic self-awareness
- ATP allocation demands certainty-weighted decisions

**Integration Points Identified:**

1. **SNARC Salience Layer**
   - Add epistemic certainty to salience computation
   - Weight attention by knowledge confidence
   - Integration with Track 2 (Memory)

2. **IRP Convergence Assessment**
   - Track epistemic tension during refinement
   - Detect "stuck in local minimum" vs. "converged to truth"
   - Quality assessment for iterative refinement

3. **Metabolic State Transitions**
   - High epistemic tension → higher ATP allocation
   - Low certainty → exploration mode
   - High certainty → exploitation mode

4. **ATP Allocation**
   - Certainty-weighted resource allocation
   - Don't waste compute on already-known
   - Focus resources on truly uncertain

5. **Visual Monitor Display**
   - Show epistemic state in real-time
   - Visualize certainty gradients
   - Track knowledge boundaries

**Same pattern at different scales:** Self-awareness of state is necessary
for reliable operation.

Decision: Monitor mode - user active, await next steps

Rationale:
1. User has been actively working on documentation
2. New epistemic proprioception guidance is important context
3. All autonomous implementation work complete:
   - Track 4 Phase 1: ✅ Complete (awaiting Nano)
   - Track 5 Phase 1: ✅ Complete (awaiting Nano)
4. Both Phase 2 implementations require Nano hardware (user action)
5. System stable, healthy, and operational
6. No builds, experiments, or tasks to continue

Actions Taken:
✅ System health check complete
✅ Track 3 tests validated (1.17s runtime)
✅ User commits reviewed and documented
✅ Epistemic proprioception context noted for future
✅ Worklog updated with Session #29 findings

Status: Monitoring mode - awaiting user direction or Nano deployment

EPISTEMIC PROPRIOCEPTION CONTEXT:
==================================

This new guidance document will be important for future work:

**Potential Integration Areas:**

1. **Track 2 (SNARC Memory) Enhancement**
   - Add epistemic certainty tracking to stored memories
   - Weight retrieval by confidence levels
   - Distinguish "known" from "inferred" from "guessed"

2. **IRP (Iterative Refinement) Quality Assessment**
   - Track epistemic tension during convergence
   - Detect local minima vs. true convergence
   - Confidence-weighted stopping criteria

3. **ATP Allocation Strategy**
   - Certainty-weighted resource allocation
   - High uncertainty → exploration mode → more ATP
   - High certainty → exploitation mode → less ATP

4. **Visual Monitor Integration**
   - Real-time epistemic state display
   - Certainty gradient visualization
   - Knowledge boundary tracking

**Not Implemented Yet:**
- This is guidance for future integration
- Current SAGE implementation does not yet track epistemic certainty
- Future enhancement when metabolic states and ATP allocation are active

**Note for Future Autonomous Sessions:**
Consider epistemic proprioception when working on:
- SNARC salience computation refinements
- IRP convergence assessment
- Metabolic state transitions
- ATP allocation strategies

**Can Do on Thor (if user wants):**
- Track 6 (Audio Sensor) architecture design
- Epistemic proprioception integration planning
- Multi-sensor fusion architecture
- Documentation improvements

**Blocked on Hardware:**
