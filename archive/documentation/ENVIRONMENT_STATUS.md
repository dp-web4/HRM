# Environment Status Report
*Date: August 17, 2025*
*Machine: DESKTOP-9E6HCAO (WSL2)*

## ‚úÖ Successfully Configured

### System Environment
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (WSL2)
- **Python**: 3.12.3
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (8GB VRAM)
- **CUDA**: 12.1 (via PyTorch, GPU passthrough working)

### Python Environment
- **Virtual Environment**: `/mnt/c/projects/ai-agents/.venv`
- **PyTorch**: 2.5.1+cu121 (with CUDA support)
- **All HRM dependencies installed** (except adam-atan2 and flash-attn)

### Test Results
- ‚úÖ PyTorch installed and working
- ‚úÖ CUDA available and functional
- ‚úÖ HRM model initialization successful
- ‚úÖ CPU forward pass working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  GPU forward pass has device mismatch issue (see below)

## üîß Workarounds Applied

### 1. Flash Attention Not Available
**Issue**: Flash Attention requires CUDA SDK and nvcc compiler, not available in WSL2
**Solution**: Using `models/layers_no_flash.py` fallback implementation
**Impact**: Slightly slower attention computation, but functionally equivalent

### 2. Adam-Atan2 Optimizer Not Installed
**Issue**: Requires CUDA_HOME and compilation
**Solution**: Can use standard Adam optimizer instead
**Impact**: Minor difference in optimization dynamics

### 3. PEP 668 Compliance
**Issue**: Ubuntu 24.04 enforces externally-managed environment
**Solution**: Using virtual environment at `.venv`
**Impact**: None - this is the correct approach

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### GPU Forward Pass Device Mismatch
**Issue**: HRM model's `self.H_init` and other init tensors not properly moved to GPU
**Location**: `models/hrm/hrm_act_v1.py` line 176
**Error**: `RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device`
**Root Cause**: Model parameters registered but init tensors are created without proper device handling

**Fix Required**: In `hrm_act_v1.py`, ensure all init tensors are registered as buffers:
```python
# Instead of:
self.H_init = torch.zeros(...)
# Use:
self.register_buffer('H_init', torch.zeros(...))
```

**Workaround**: Run models on CPU for now, or fix the model's device handling

## üìù Environment Setup Commands

To recreate this environment:

```bash
# 1. Install system dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv build-essential

# 2. Create virtual environment
cd /mnt/c/projects/ai-agents
python3 -m venv .venv

# 3. Activate and upgrade pip
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# 4. Install PyTorch with CUDA
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# 5. Install HRM dependencies (minus problematic ones)
cd HRM
pip install einops tqdm coolname pydantic argdantic wandb omegaconf hydra-core huggingface_hub

# 6. Run tests
python test_environment.py
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Fix GPU device issue**: Update HRM model to properly handle device placement
2. **Test SAGE-Totality integration**: Once basic HRM works on GPU
3. **Test GPU mailbox architecture**: Critical for zero-copy communication
4. **Consider Docker**: For consistent environment across machines

## ‚úÖ Summary

The environment is **functionally ready** for SAGE/HRM experiments with these considerations:
- CPU execution works perfectly
- GPU execution needs minor model fixes
- All critical dependencies installed
- CUDA/GPU passthrough confirmed working
- Write-once-run-everywhere goal achieved (with documented workarounds)

The main achievement is that we have a **properly configured environment** that matches other machines in the network, with clear documentation of what works and what needs fixing.
