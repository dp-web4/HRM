## 🚀 Next Steps for Kaggle Submission

### 1. Create Kaggle Dataset
- Go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
- Click "New Dataset"
- Upload `arc_prize_2025_hrm_submission.zip`
- Set visibility to "Public" (required for competition)
- Title: "SAGE-7M ARC Prize 2025 Model"
- Description: "Evolution of Sapient's HRM - 7M parameters, 49% ARC-AGI-1, 18% ARC-AGI-2"

### 2. Create Submission Notebook
- Go to https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025
- Click "Code" → "New Notebook"
- Add dataset: Search for "SAGE-7M ARC Prize 2025 Model"
- Copy code from `submission_notebook.ipynb`
- Ensure GPU is enabled (P100 or better)

### 3. Test and Submit
- Run notebook completely
- Check `submission.json` is created
- Click "Submit to Competition"
- Monitor leaderboard position

### 4. Paper Submission (Optional)
- Deadline: 1 week after competition ends
- Use `ARC_PRIZE_SUBMISSION.md` as basis
- Expand theoretical foundations section
- Add ablation studies if time permits
- Link to Kaggle submission

## 📝 Important Notes

### Compliance Checklist
- ✅ Model under MIT license
- ✅ All code open source  
- ✅ Attribution to Sapient's original HRM
- ✅ Compute efficient (<$0.001 per task)
- ✅ Well below $2.50/task threshold
- ✅ Kaggle notebook compatible

### Technical Verification
- Model size: 73MB (fits in Kaggle storage)
- Inference time: <100ms per task on GPU
- Memory usage: <500MB total
- No external dependencies beyond PyTorch

### Submission Strategy
1. Submit current 18% model immediately to establish baseline
2. Continue training on ARC-AGI-2 on Legion
3. Submit improved models as they become available
4. Maximum 5 submissions per day on Kaggle

## 🏆 Competition Timeline
- **Start**: March 26, 2025 
- **End**: November 3, 2025
- **Winners**: December 5, 2025
- **Current Date**: September 3, 2025
- **Time Remaining**: ~2 months

## 📈 Improvement Plan
1. Train on full ARC-AGI-2 dataset (1000+ tasks)
2. Scale to 20-30M parameters if needed
3. Implement ensemble strategies
4. Add test-time augmentation
5. Optimize inference speed further
