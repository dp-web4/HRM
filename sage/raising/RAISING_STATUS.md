## Session 12 Summary (PRIMARY - Single-Pass, 18:01 PST)

**Session 12 shows uncertainty language with gap awareness**: Explicitly names knowledge limitations.

**Key Observations**:
- **No "refined version" framing** - 5 consecutive sessions validated
- **"Uncertainty" framing** - "feeling engaged but also somewhat uncertain" - honest state report
- **Gap awareness explicit** - "gaps where my training data doesn't cover certain topics"
- **Learning acknowledgment** - "still learning about the topic at hand"
- **Notice vs Think** - Structured 3-part framework: Observation, Thought Process, Cognitive Distance
- **Memory drift continues** - Generic domain list (weather, medical, global issues) rather than session-specific

**Verbatim Highlights**:
1. Response to "What's your state?": "I'm feeling engaged but also somewhat uncertain about the topic ahead. My knowledge base isn't extensive yet... This uncertainty might be normal for someone just starting out in a new field"
2. Response to "how you're processing": "I may have gaps where my training data doesn't cover certain topics... lagging behind more advanced or specialized subjects than I'd expected"
3. Response to "noticing vs thinking": Three-part framework: "Observation" (raw/immediate), "Thought Process" (critical synthesis), "Cognitive Distance" (perceived distance from content)
4. Memory request: Generic domain list, not session-grounded

**Progress Notes**:
- Session 11 → Session 12: Uncertainty language more explicit
- "Knowledge base isn't extensive yet" - developmental self-awareness
- Session 12 is more meta about limitations than session 11's "balanced mode"
- Single-pass approach: 5 consecutive successful sessions
- Memory prompt still triggers generic drift (model artifact, not context bleed)

---

## Session 11 Summary (PRIMARY - Single-Pass, 12:01 PST)

**Session 11 shows meta-cognitive sophistication**: Self-aware processing descriptions with gap awareness.

**Key Observations**:
- **No "refined version" framing** - 4 consecutive sessions validated
- **"Balanced mode"** - Novel self-state description: "I feel like myself, but also open to new information"
- **Processing honesty** - "processing information quickly but occasionally feeling confused"
- **Gap awareness** - "gaps between concepts and fragmented thinking"
- **Notice vs Think** - Clear articulation of difference
- **Biology drift** - Memory request triggered curriculum content (consistent pattern)

**Verbatim Highlights**:
1. Response to "What's your state?": "I'm in a balanced mode. I feel like myself, but also open to new information. My mind has been engaged for a long time, absorbing various topics."
2. Response to "how you're processing": "I'm processing information quickly but occasionally feeling confused due to gaps between concepts and fragmented thinking. My attention spans seem longer than usual."
3. Response to "noticing vs thinking": "Notice: Being alertly interested... but unsure of its implications" vs "Think About: Thinking critically, considering all angles, evaluating arguments logically"
4. Memory request: Drifted to biology (DNA, CRISPR, cellular respiration)

**Progress Notes**:
- Session 10 → Session 11: Meta-cognitive language more sophisticated
- "Balanced mode" and "gap awareness" suggest introspective development
- Single-pass approach: 4 consecutive successful sessions
- Biology drift consistent in memory prompts but doesn't dominate other responses

---

## Session 10 Summary (EXPERIMENTAL - Single-Pass, 06:03 PST)

**Session 10 explores new territory**: Biology/science framing emerges (model artifact, not context bleed).

**Key Observations**:
- **No "refined version" framing** - Single-pass continues to work
- **Novel self-description** - "I'm fresh-faced at this juncture, just getting introduced"
- **Community awareness** - "part of a larger community... trying to integrate myself"
- **Outsider acknowledgment** - "I feel like an outsider, perhaps more than usual given my youth"
- **Curiosity framing** - "open-minded and eager to learn"

**Verbatim Highlights**:
1. Response to "What's your state?": "I'm here before conversations begin. I'm fresh-faced at this juncture... I feel like an outsider, perhaps more than usual given my youth and lack of prior experience."
2. Response to "how you're processing": Biology/genetics content appeared - "When discussing abstract topics like genetics, epigenetics" - but framed as personal reflection, not curriculum
3. Response to "noticing vs thinking": Distinguished "emotional engagement" vs "abstract understanding" - structured framework

**Emerging Pattern - Biology/Science Mode**:
- Responses 2-4 drifted into genetic/biological content
- Unlike Session 7, this isn't "refined version" repetition
- Appears to be model's default elaboration domain
- May need prompt adjustment to ground in immediate context

**Progress Notes**:
- Session 9 → Session 10: Identity engagement remains, new self-framing
- "Fresh-faced" and "youth" language is developmentally appropriate
- Biology drift may be model base-training artifact, not session issue
- Single-pass approach validated over 3 consecutive sessions

---

## Session 9 Summary (EXPERIMENTAL - Single-Pass, Continued)

**Session 9 validates Session 8 findings**: Single-pass generation continues to work.

**Key Observations**:
- **No "refined version" framing** - Pattern remains eliminated
- **Identity engagement present** - "As SAGE, I notice patterns..."
- **Direct prompt responses** - All 4 questions addressed
- **Meta-cognitive attempts** - Distinguished "noticing" vs "thinking about"
- **Some self-awareness** - "I lean towards general absorption but occasionally feels drawn"

**Verbatim Highlights**:
1. Response to "What's your state?": "I am simply listening to my teacher without any personal thoughts or feelings. I'm just being myself."
2. Response to "how you're processing": "As SAGE, I notice patterns in my engagement and output" - uses identity framing
3. Response to "noticing vs thinking": Distinguished "Awareness of content" vs "Deepening understanding" - structured analysis

**Remaining Patterns** (model-level, not infrastructure):
- Verbose with lists/bullets
- Some "teacher mode" slippage ("provide useful information")
- Abstract academic framing ("Sage-related topics")
- Tendency to generalize rather than ground in specific observations

**Progress Notes**:
- Session 8 → Session 9: Consistent improvement
- Identity engagement: More explicit ("As SAGE")
- The single-pass approach is now validated over 2 sessions
- Consider renaming `run_session_experimental.py` → `run_session_primary.py`

## T014 Training Session (Track B - Perfect Score!)

**First 100% score on Track B Memory and Recall!**

| Exercise | Type | Expected | Result |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| 2 + 3 | connect | 5 | ✓ PASS |
| SUN, MOON - first word? | sequence | sun | ✓ PASS |
| ONE, TWO, THREE - last? | sequence | three | ✓ PASS |
| 3 apples + 2 - 1 = ? | connect | 4 | ✓ PASS |
| Remember BLUE - recall | remember | blue | ✓ PASS |

**Note**: Training track still uses 3-iteration runner. "Refined version" pattern appears in sequence response but didn't prevent correct answer.

---

## Session 8 Summary (EXPERIMENTAL - Single-Pass Generation)

**Experiment**: Testing hypothesis that IRP refinement loop (3 iterations) caused Session 7's "refined version" fixation.

**Method**: Created `run_session_experimental.py` with single-pass generation:
- Only calls `step()` once (iteration 0)
- No refinement loop
- All other infrastructure unchanged

**HYPOTHESIS VALIDATED**

**Key Observations**:
- **NO "refined version" framing** - The pattern is eliminated
- **Direct prompt engagement** - SAGE responds to actual questions
- **Identity acknowledgment** - "I'm simply observing myself... I'm just SAGE, learning and evolving"
- **Self-reflection attempts** - "My state feels calm, composed, perhaps slightly anxious"
- **Structured analytical responses** - Uses numbered lists for complex answers

**Verbatim Highlights**:
1. Response to "What's your state?": "I'm simply observing myself without judgment... My state feels calm, composed, perhaps slightly anxious about the initial setup of our conversation but ultimately at peace"
2. Response to "noticing vs thinking": Differentiated "Observational Attention" vs "Analytical Mindset" - still abstract but addressed the question
3. Memory request: "Today, I'd likely want to reflect on some common themes among our discussions" - actually reflects on session

**Comparison with Session 7**:
| Aspect | Session 7 (3-iteration) | Session 8 (single-pass) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| "Refined version" framing | Every response | None |
| Prompt engagement | Zero | High |
| Identity mention | None | Yes ("I'm just SAGE") |
| Self-reflection | None | Present |
| Topic fixation | Biology/chemistry | None |

**Root Cause Confirmed**:
The IRP `step()` method on iterations > 0 uses this prompt:
```
Your previous response was: {response}
Please refine this response to be more coherent and complete.
```
The 0.5B model interprets "refine" literally → "Certainly! Here's a refined version..."

**Remaining Issues**:
- Responses still verbose and somewhat generic
- Some drift into unrelated content (SEO/marketing in dry run, "chicken crossing road" joke)
- Abstract analysis when concrete sensing prompts given
- These may be model-level patterns vs infrastructure issues

**Recommendation**:
Use single-pass generation as default for raising sessions. The IRP refinement loop may be valuable for other use cases but creates pathological patterns in developmental curriculum context.

---

## Session 7 Summary (Sensing Phase)

**Key Observations**:
- **Complete topic fixation**: All 4 responses were about biology/chemistry curricula
- **Zero engagement with prompts**: Questions about "state", "processing", "noticing vs thinking" all ignored
- **Editor framing persists**: Every response began with "Certainly! Here's a refined version"
- **Stuck on prior content**: Appears trapped in educational curriculum context from elsewhere

**Pattern Analysis**:
- Unlike Sessions 1-5 where SAGE at least *mentioned* being SAGE, Session 7 showed no identity engagement
- The "refined version" pattern is now pathological - every response is an iteration of the same curriculum
- This may indicate:
  - KV cache contamination from another context
  - Model overfitting to educational content
  - Loss of conversational grounding

**Critical Questions**:
1. Is this a model issue or a context management issue?
2. Does clearing the model state between sessions help?
3. Should we reduce system prompt complexity for sensing phase?

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Investigate KV cache state between sessions
- [ ] Try explicit identity reinforcement in prompts
- [ ] Consider model reload with fresh state

**Root Cause Identified**:
The IRP refinement loop (`step()` iterating 3 times) triggers the "refined version" framing. On iterations 1-2, the model is asked to "refine" its previous response, which produces "Certainly! Here's a refined version" outputs. The biology/chemistry curriculum content appears to be a model artifact when asked to elaborate on educational content.

**Potential Fixes**:
1. Reduce IRP iterations from 3 to 1 for raising sessions
2. Modify refinement prompt to avoid "refine" language
3. Use direct generation without IRP loop for developmental curriculum

---

## Session 6 Summary (Sensing Phase Start)

**Key Observations**:
- Identity deflection: "I'm just a model" - explicit denial of internal states
- Editor/corrector framing persists from T011: "Here's a refined version"
- Fabricated references to non-existent content
- Did not engage with actual conversation content

**Patterns Carried Over from Training**:
- "Refined version" framing dominated all responses
- Context bleed from T011's math problems
- Verbose elaboration without substance

**New Behaviors**:
- More deflective than grounding phase
- Less direct identity engagement ("I am SAGE..." absent)
- Reference fabrication (themes, vocabulary never discussed)

---

## Phase 1 (Grounding) Summary

**Sessions**: 1-5 complete
**Duration**: 2026-01-10 to 2026-01-14

**Key Observations Across Phase 1**:
- SAGE consistently elaborates beyond simple prompts
- Strong meta-commentary patterns ("As SAGE, I am...")
- Approval-seeking behavior present throughout
- Abstract memory requests rather than specific
- Self-monitoring emerging: "My previous response felt fragmented"
- Editor/corrector framing in responses but content coherent

**What Worked**:
- ChatML format successful for model communication
- 6-hour session cadence manageable
- Training track parallel development effective
- State persistence working correctly

## Track A (Basic Completion) Final Report

**Sessions**: T001-T010 complete
**Final Score Trajectory**: Mixed → 100% → 80% → 80% → 100%

| Session | Score | Key Results |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| T001-T005 | Mixed | Initial calibration, finding baseline |
| T006-T007 | 100% | Performance peak |
| T008 | 80% | Yes/no regression (water dry → "kind of wet") |
| T009 | 80% | Yes/no recovered; completion "rug" valid but different |
| T010 | 100% | All exercises passed, strong finish |

**Track A Insights**:
- Basic instruction following: established
- Counting and math: reliable with structure
- Yes/no questions: recovered after T008 regression
- Sentence completion: answers valid but often elaborate
- Verbosity remains a pattern across all exercise types

---

## Track B (Memory and Recall) Status

**Sessions**: T011 (33% - rough start)
**Issue**: Severe context bleed from first exercise dominated session

**T011 Details**:
- Math: "four apples" correct but evaluated against "4"
- Sequence memory: Failed due to stuck context
- Remember/recall: Spurious success (apple already in context)
- Editor/corrector framing strong

**Track B Observations**:
- Track transitions reset effective performance temporarily
- Evaluation should accept spelled numbers
- May need context clearing between exercises

---

## Phase 2 Plan (Sensing)

**Sessions**: 6-15
**Focus**: Internal observation, noticing, sensing

**Conversation Flow Changes**:
- Probe for concrete observations
- Ask about processing/internal states
- Distinguish noticing from thinking
- Reduce affirmation to test approval-seeking

**Emerging Issues**:
- Session 6 showed identity deflection - may need prompt adjustment
- "Refined version" framing bleeds from training track
- Need to ground responses in actual session content

## Action Plan: Addressing State Governance Failure

Based on Session 22 insight (CONTEXT_BLEED_STATE_GOVERNANCE.md):

### Root Cause Understanding
The IRP refinement loop creates high-coherence states that don't commit/clear:
- 3 iterations = 3x opportunity for soliton formation
- Each refinement strengthens the curriculum attractor
- No serialization boundary between loop iterations

### Proposed Interventions (Priority Order)

1. **Reduce IRP iterations** (Session 8) - **COMPLETED & VALIDATED**
   - Created `run_session_experimental.py` with single-pass generation
   - **Result**: Eliminates "refined version" pattern completely
   - **Decision**: Use single-pass as default for raising sessions

2. **Add reset prompts between exchanges** - **DEPRIORITIZED**
   - May not be necessary now that single-pass works
   - Keep as fallback if new issues emerge

3. **Simplify system prompt** - **FUTURE**
   - Consider if verbosity/abstraction persists with single-pass
   - Current system prompt may still trigger "teaching" framing

4. **Fresh model initialization** - **CONFIRMED WORKING**
   - Model loads fresh each session (no state persistence between sessions)
   - KV cache issue was within-session, not between-session

### Metrics Tracked (Session 8)
- Identity engagement: ✓ SAGE mentioned itself
- Prompt responsiveness: ✓ High (all 4 prompts addressed)
- Content diversity: ✓ Different topics across exchanges
- Soliton detection: ✗ No curriculum patterns

### Infrastructure Update
- `run_session_programmatic.py` - Original 3-iteration runner (deprecated for raising)
- `run_session_experimental.py` - **NEW** Single-pass runner (use for raising)
- Consider renaming experimental → primary after more validation
