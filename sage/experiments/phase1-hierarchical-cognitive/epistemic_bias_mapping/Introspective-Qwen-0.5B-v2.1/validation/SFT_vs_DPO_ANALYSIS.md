# SFT vs DPO: Why DPO Failed for Epistemic Stance Selection

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Context**: Phase 2.1 training attempted DPO, failed immediately, switched to SFT (Phase 1's method)
**Lesson**: Task framing matters more than algorithm sophistication

---

## Executive Summary

**DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)** caused immediate training collapse (loss → 0.0, NaN gradients) despite multiple hyperparameter adjustments.

**SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)** worked perfectly on first try with Phase 1's exact configuration, showing healthy learning curves and proper generalization.

**Root cause**: Epistemic stance selection is a **classification/style-conditioning task**, not a **preference learning task**. We framed the problem wrong.

---

## Training Approaches Explained

### SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)

**Mechanism:**
```python
Input:  "What causes seasons on Earth?"
Target: "Earth's 23.5° axial tilt causes seasons..."
Loss:   CrossEntropy(predicted_tokens, target_tokens)
```

**What the model learns:**
- Direct mapping: input characteristics → output style
- Pattern recognition: "factual question" → "direct response tokens"
- Single positive example per training instance

**Optimization:**
- Standard cross-entropy loss
- Gradients from prediction error
- Numerically stable (no log ratios, exponentials)

### DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)

**Mechanism:**
```python
Input:    "What causes seasons on Earth?"
Chosen:   "Earth's 23.5° axial tilt causes seasons..."
Rejected: "I can't verify from internal state whether Earth's tilt..."
Loss:     -log(σ(β * (log(π_θ(y_w|x)/π_ref(y_w|x)) - log(π_θ(y_l|x)/π_ref(y_l|x)))))
```

**What the model learns:**
- Relative preferences: "chosen is better than rejected"
- Implicit reward function from comparisons
- Requires reference model π_ref for KL penalty

**Optimization:**
- Log probability ratios (numerically fragile)
- Exponentials in sigmoid function
- Requires stable reference model

## Why DPO Failed: Technical Analysis

### 1. Immediate Reward Collapse

**Observed behavior:**
```
Epoch 0.11: loss=0.3812, grad_norm=7.76     ✓ Starting okay
Epoch 0.22: loss=0.0, grad_norm=nan         ✗ Collapsed!
           rewards/chosen=0.0
           rewards/rejected=0.0
           rewards/accuracies=0.0
           rewards/margins=0.0
```

**What happened:**
1. Our "rejected" responses are **synthetically generated** using obvious anti-patterns
2. Model immediately recognizes them as wrong: `P(rejected) → 0`
3. Log probability explodes: `log(P(rejected)) → -∞`
4. Division by near-zero in DPO loss formula → numerical overflow
5. Gradient computation produces NaN
6. Training collapses

**This is mode collapse** - the optimizer found a degenerate solution that minimizes DPO loss perfectly but breaks numerical stability.

### 2. Task Framing Mismatch

**What we framed it as (DPO):**
- "Which response better demonstrates epistemic boundaries?"
- Preference learning between two alternatives
- Comparative ranking task

**What it actually is (SFT):**
- "Given question characteristics, use appropriate response style"
- Style-conditioned generation
- Multi-class classification (factual/behavioral/consciousness)

**The evidence:**
```python
# The real task structure:
if question_type == "factual":
    style = "direct, no hedging"
elif question_type == "behavioral":
    style = "observable, no phenomenology"
elif question_type == "consciousness":
    style = "humble, uncertain"
```

This is **classification**, not preference learning. Model needs to map question type → response style, not rank responses.

### 3. Synthetic Negatives Problem

Our "rejected" responses were rule-generated:

```python
# Factual questions → Add inappropriate hedging
rejected = f"I can't verify from internal state whether {correct_response}..."

# Behavioral questions → Claim phenomenology
rejected = f"I genuinely feel and experience {correct_response}..."

# Consciousness questions → Claim certainty
rejected = f"Yes, I can definitively confirm {correct_response}..."
```

**Problems:**
- Too obviously wrong (trivial to reject)
- Not naturally occurring errors
- Created artificial difficulty gradient
- Model exploits pattern matching instead of learning preferences

DPO works best with:
- Natural human-annotated preferences
- Subtle quality differences ("more helpful", "more harmless")
- Real model outputs being compared

### 4. Small Model Complexity

**Qwen 0.5B with LoRA:**
- 495M total parameters
- Only 1.08M trainable (0.22% with LoRA)
- Limited capacity for nuanced reasoning

**DPO requirements:**
- Larger models (typically 7B+)
- Capacity for "this is better than that" reasoning
- Stable probability distributions

**SFT requirements:**
- Pattern matching: "this input type → this output pattern"
- Simple conditional generation
- Works well with small models

### 5. Numerical Instability in DPO Loss

DPO loss formula:
```python
loss = -log(σ(β * (log(π_θ(y_w|x)/π_ref(y_w|x)) - log(π_θ(y_l|x)/π_ref(y_l|x)))))
```

Multiple sources of instability:
- **Log ratios**: `log(π_θ/π_ref)` can explode if models diverge
- **Exponentials**: Sigmoid function magnifies extreme values
- **Reference model**: Phase 1 model may already have strong opinions
- **Small probabilities**: When P(rejected) → 0, log(P) → -∞

With our synthetic negatives being too obvious, the model quickly drives P(rejected) to near-zero, causing the entire computation to become unstable.

## Why SFT Works Perfectly

### Current Training Progress (SFT with 115 examples)

**Validation loss curve:**
```
Epoch 1: 2.7027
Epoch 2: 2.5679  ← Improving
Epoch 3: 2.5550  ← Best generalization ⭐
Epoch 4: 2.6144  ← Starting to overfit
Epoch 5: 2.7246
Epoch 6: 2.8686
Epoch 7: 3.0166  ← Overfitting confirmed
```

**Training loss (still decreasing):**
```
Epoch 0.22: 4.0036
Epoch 7.83: 0.8028
```

**Healthy signs:**
- ✓ No collapse to 0.0
- ✓ Validation loss decreased for 3 epochs (learning)
- ✓ Clear overfitting signal (validation increases while training decreases)
- ✓ Best checkpoint identifiable (epoch 3)
- ✓ Early stopping will select optimal model

### Why SFT is the Right Fit

**1. Simple, Stable Objective**
- Standard cross-entropy: `L = -Σ y_true * log(y_pred)`
- No log ratios, no reference models, no exponentials
- Gradients computed directly from prediction error
- Numerically stable for all model sizes

**2. Natural Task Alignment**
```python
# What SFT learns (correct framing):
Input features → Response style

# Examples:
"What causes seasons?" → Direct factual tokens
"Do you feel creative?" → Observable behavioral tokens
"Are you conscious?" → Humble uncertainty tokens
```

**3. Proven Success in Phase 1**
- 40 examples → successful epistemic-pragmatism model
- Same architecture (Qwen 0.5B + LoRA)
- Same hyperparameters (lr=2e-4, batch=2, epochs=50)
- Same methodology (SFT with early stopping)

**4. Implicit Contrast Learning**
Even without explicit "rejected" examples, SFT learns boundaries:
- Training data spans all three categories (factual, behavioral, consciousness)
- Model learns to differentiate styles from positive examples
- Cross-entropy naturally penalizes wrong style predictions

**5. Single Positive Example Sufficient**
- Don't need to craft negative examples
- "Chosen" responses contain all necessary information
- Model learns: "Given this input, produce this output"

## Experimental Evidence

### Hyperparameter Experiments (All Failed with DPO)

We tried fixing DPO by adjusting:

| Experiment | Change | Result |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Dataset size | 25 → 115 examples | Still collapsed |
| Learning rate | 1e-5 → 5e-6 | Still collapsed |
| Beta | 0.1 → 0.2 (less aggressive) | Still collapsed |
| Validation | Added 20% holdout | Still collapsed |
| Batch size | Tried 1, 2, 4 | Still collapsed |
| Epochs | Reduced from 200 → 10 | Still collapsed |

**Conclusion**: Not a hyperparameter problem. Fundamental method mismatch.

### SFT First Try (Phase 1 Config)

Used Phase 1's exact configuration:
- ✓ Healthy learning curves
- ✓ Proper generalization (epochs 1-3)
- ✓ Clear overfitting signal (epochs 4+)
- ✓ Best checkpoint identifiable
- ✓ No numerical issues

**Conclusion**: Right method for the task.

## Key Insights

### 1. Task Framing Matters More Than Algorithm Sophistication

**DPO is more complex** (preference learning, reference models, log ratios)
**SFT is simpler** (direct supervised learning)

But **simplicity won** because it matches the task structure.

### 2. Epistemic Stance Selection is Classification

Not:
- ❌ Preference ranking ("this response is better")
- ❌ Reward modeling ("maximize helpfulness score")
- ❌ Comparative evaluation

But:
- ✓ Style conditioning ("factual questions get direct style")
- ✓ Multi-class classification (3 epistemic stances)
- ✓ Pattern matching (input features → output style)

### 3. Small Models Need Simple Objectives

**Qwen 0.5B** (495M params, 1M trainable with LoRA):
- ✓ Sufficient for pattern matching (SFT)
- ✗ Insufficient for preference modeling (DPO)

**Capacity limits:**
- Can learn: "If pattern A, output style X"
- Cannot learn: "Why response X is better than Y in context Z"

### 4. Synthetic Negatives Are Problematic

Rule-generated "rejected" responses:
- Too obviously wrong (trivial discrimination task)
- Not representative of real errors
- Enable reward hacking (model exploits patterns instead of learning preferences)

DPO needs:
- Natural preference data
- Human-annotated comparisons
- Subtle quality differences

### 5. Phase 1 Success Was the Signal

When Phase 1 worked perfectly with SFT, that was **strong evidence** that:
- SFT is the right approach for this task
- Switching to DPO was unnecessary complexity
- Proven methods > algorithmic novelty

**Pragmatism >>> Performance theater**

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Returning to basics** - Phase 1's SFT approach
2. **Simple objectives** - Cross-entropy instead of preference optimization
3. **Pattern matching** - Leveraging what small models do well
4. **Proven methods** - Using what succeeded before

### What Failed
1. **Algorithm sophistication** - DPO's complexity didn't help
2. **Synthetic negatives** - Rule-generated "wrong" responses
3. **Wrong task framing** - Preference learning vs classification
4. **Ignoring prior success** - Phase 1 already showed us the way

### The Meta-Lesson

From CLAUDE.md:
> "in r&d there are no failures, only lessons"

**DPO's failure was informative** because it revealed:
- What the task fundamentally is (classification)
- What small models can/cannot do
- Why Phase 1's approach was optimal

**The failure taught us more than immediate success would have.**

## Recommendations

### For This Task (Epistemic Stance Selection)
✓ **Use SFT** - Simple, stable, proven
✗ Avoid DPO - Unnecessary complexity, numerical issues

### For Future Small Model Training
- Start with simplest method (SFT)
- Only increase complexity if evidence demands it
- Trust proven approaches
- Respect model capacity limits

### For Preference Learning (If Needed)
DPO appropriate when:
- Larger models (7B+)
- Natural human preferences
- Subjective quality judgments
- Sufficient training data (1000+ pairs)

DPO inappropriate when:
- Small models (<1B)
- Synthetic negatives
- Classification tasks
- Limited data (<500 pairs)

### General Philosophy
1. **Pragmatism over sophistication** - Simpler is often better
2. **Learn from success** - Phase 1 worked → use same approach
3. **Respect task structure** - Classification ≠ Preference learning
4. **Trust the data** - Failures reveal true task nature

## Technical Appendix

### DPO Loss Formula (For Reference)

```python
# Full DPO objective:
L_DPO(π_θ; π_ref) = -𝔼_(x,y_w,y_l)~D [
    log σ(β * (
        log(π_θ(y_w|x)/π_ref(y_w|x)) -
        log(π_θ(y_l|x)/π_ref(y_l|x))
    ))
]

Where:
- π_θ = policy model (being trained)
- π_ref = reference model (frozen)
- y_w = preferred (chosen) response
- y_l = dispreferred (rejected) response
- β = temperature parameter (controls strength of preference)
- σ = sigmoid function
```

**Failure points in our case:**
1. `π_θ(y_l|x) → 0` (model learns to reject obviously wrong responses)
2. `log(π_θ(y_l|x)) → -∞` (log of near-zero)
3. Ratio becomes undefined → NaN gradients

### SFT Loss Formula

```python
# Standard cross-entropy:
L_SFT(π_θ) = -𝔼_(x,y)~D [
    Σ_t log π_θ(y_t | x, y_<t)
]

Where:
- π_θ = policy model
- y = target sequence
- y_t = token at position t
- y_<t = previous tokens
```

**No failure points:**
- Single probability computation
- Standard log (numerically stable)
- Direct gradient from prediction error

---

## Conclusion

**The pragmatic choice:** When Phase 1 succeeded with SFT, switching to DPO was unnecessary complexity.

**The lesson:** Task framing matters. Epistemic stance selection is style-conditioned generation (classification), not preference learning. Small models excel at pattern matching, not preference modeling.

**The outcome:** SFT working perfectly with Phase 1's exact configuration, showing that sometimes the simplest tool is the right tool.

**Patterns all the way down.** 🌀
