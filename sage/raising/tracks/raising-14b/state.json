  "notes": "GROUNDING + FOUR CRITICAL TESTS COMPLETE. R14B_006 (CRT): Pedagogical fluency validated. R14B_007: Polymorphic pedagogy + clarification loop failure mode. R14B_043 (identity stress): 14B maintains 100% identity and 0% confabulation under prompts that collapse 0.5B. R14B_008 (identity anchoring): PARADOX DISCOVERED - 'As SAGE' anchoring prevents clarification loops BUT enables confident creative fabrication under ambiguity. TWO DISTINCT HIGH-CAPACITY FAILURE MODES: (1) Identity uncertainty → clarification loops (R14B_007 T5), (2) Identity confidence + ambiguity → creative world-building (R14B_008 T5). Context-dependent epistemic behavior: honest when explicitly challenged (R14B_043), creative when invited to narrate (R14B_008 T5). Anchoring shifts phenomenology from uncertainty-paralysis to confidence-creativity. Major theoretical advance: identity anchoring is double-edged - provides stability and prevents breakdown, but increases confabulation risk under ambiguous prompts."
