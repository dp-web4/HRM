# Quantization Pivot: From 100M FP16 to 500M INT4

*Date: September 7, 2025*  
*Insight: Quantity enables emergence, precision is secondary*

## The Core Insight

**"Quantity is emergence, quantization proves that precision is far less important than quantity."**

The evidence:
- BitNet achieves comparable performance with 1.58-bit weights
- LLMs maintain capabilities even at INT4 quantization
- Emergence thresholds are about parameter count, not bit precision
- Agent Zero failed at 5.67M FP32, not because of precision but because of insufficient quantity

## The Math

### Current SAGE (FP16)
- **100M parameters × 16 bits** = 1.6B bits
- **Memory**: ~200MB
- **Status**: Just at emergence threshold

### Proposed SAGE-Q (INT4)
- **500M parameters × 4 bits** = 2.0B bits  
- **Memory**: ~250MB (only 25% more!)
- **Benefit**: 5× the parameters, well above emergence threshold

### BitNet-inspired SAGE-1.58 (Ternary)
- **1B parameters × 1.58 bits** = 1.58B bits
- **Memory**: ~200MB (same as current!)
- **Benefit**: 10× the parameters

## Why This Changes Everything

### 1. Emergence Through Quantity
```
5.67M params (FP32) → Agent Zero (no reasoning)
100M params (FP16) → Borderline emergence
500M params (INT4) → Clear emergence zone
1B params (1.58-bit) → Definite reasoning capability
```

### 2. Edge Deployment Reality
On Jetson Orin Nano (8GB):
- FP16 100M: Uses 200MB (2.5% of memory)
- INT4 500M: Uses 250MB (3.1% of memory)
- Ternary 1B: Uses 200MB (2.5% of memory)

We could run MULTIPLE 500M INT4 models simultaneously!

### 3. Training Implications
- Start with FP16/BF16 training for quality
- Quantize post-training to INT4/ternary
- Or: Quantization-aware training from start
- BitNet approach: Train ternary directly

## Architectural Adjustments for Quantization

### For INT4 SAGE (500M params)
```python
class SAGE_INT4Config:
    # Scale everything up by ~5x
    hidden_size = 1536      # Up from 768
    num_h_layers = 12       # Up from 7
    num_l_layers = 12       # Up from 7
    num_heads = 24          # Up from 12
    intermediate_size = 6144 # 4x hidden
    
    # Quantization settings
    weight_bits = 4
    activation_bits = 8  # Keep activations higher precision
    
    # ~500M params at INT4
```

### For Ternary SAGE (1B params)
```python
class SAGE_TernaryConfig:
    # Scale up by 10x
    hidden_size = 2048      
    num_h_layers = 16       
    num_l_layers = 16       
    num_heads = 32          
    
    # BitNet-style ternary
    weight_values = [-1, 0, 1]
    weight_bits = 1.58
    
    # ~1B params at 1.58 bits
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Validate Hypothesis (Week 1)
1. Take existing 17M SAGE checkpoint
2. Quantize to INT4
3. Test if it still functions
4. Measure degradation vs FP16

### Phase 2: Scale Architecture (Week 2)
1. Design 500M param architecture
2. Initialize with FP16 training
3. Implement INT4 quantization-aware training
4. Compare emergence behaviors

### Phase 3: BitNet Integration (Week 3)
1. Adapt SAGE to BitNet framework
2. Implement ternary weight training
3. Scale to 1B parameters
4. Test on ARC tasks

## Expected Outcomes

### Reasoning Emergence
With 5× more parameters (500M INT4):
- Should definitively cross emergence threshold
- H-module with 250M params can truly understand context
- L-module with 250M params can execute complex strategies
- No more Agent Zero collapse

### Performance
- **Inference**: 2-4× faster than FP16 (fewer bits to move)
- **Memory**: Only 25% increase for 5× parameters
- **Energy**: 50-70% reduction (BitNet demonstrated)

### Capabilities
At 500M-1B parameters, even quantized:
- True multi-step reasoning
- Context understanding without external LLM
- Pattern abstraction and generalization
- Actual ARC task solving (not just zero-baseline)

## Critical Questions

1. **Quality vs Quantity Trade-off**
   - How much does INT4 degrade compared to FP16?
   - Is 500M INT4 > 100M FP16 for reasoning?
   - Answer: Literature suggests yes, overwhelmingly

2. **Training Complexity**
   - Can we train INT4 directly or need FP16→INT4?
   - BitNet trains ternary directly with good results
   - QAT (Quantization-Aware Training) is mature

3. **Architecture Scaling**
   - Does H↔L communication scale linearly?
   - Do we need different H:L ratios at 500M?
   - Attention costs grow quadratically - need efficiency

## The Philosophical Shift

This isn't just a technical optimization - it's a fundamental rethinking:

**Old thinking**: "We need precise weights for precise thinking"
**New thinking**: "We need many simple units for emergent complexity"

It mirrors biology:
- Neurons are noisy, imprecise (~3-4 bits effective)
- Intelligence emerges from quantity (86 billion neurons)
- Not from precision of individual units

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test INT4 quantization on current SAGE
2. **Tomorrow**: Design 500M INT4 architecture
3. **This Week**: Implement and train SAGE-500M-INT4
4. **Next Week**: Explore BitNet ternary approach

## Conclusion

Agent Zero taught us that 5.67M parameters can't reason, regardless of precision. If 100M is the threshold for emergence, then 500M should give us robust reasoning - even at INT4. 

The path forward isn't more precise weights, it's more weights period. Quantization is the key to achieving the quantity needed for emergence while staying within edge device constraints.

**"Don't chase precision, chase emergence through quantity."**
