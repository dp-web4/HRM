"""
Baseline SAGE Loop Test
Experiment: What happens in sensory deprivation?

Question: How does SNARC behave with no sensors?
- Does it handle empty observations gracefully?
- What does "salience" mean when there's nothing to sense?
- Does trust evolve or stay flat?
- Do we see any emergent patterns?

Approach: Run kernel for 20 cycles, observe, document surprises.
