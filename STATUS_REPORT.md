# HRM/SAGE Project Status Report

*Date: September 6, 2025*  
*Status: Synced with remote, architecture built, Agent Zero confirmed*

## Current State

### âœ… Completed Work

1. **SAGE Architecture Implementation (110M parameters)**
   - Built complete SAGE core with Hâ†”L bidirectional communication
   - Implemented SNARC scoring system for attention prioritization
   - Created multi-modal sensor interface (vision, language, memory, time)
   - Developed training pipeline with multi-component loss functions

2. **Agent Zero Confirmation**
   - Verified HRM checkpoint outputs all zeros (34.64% accuracy from zero-baseline)
   - Confirmed our SAGE also exhibits Agent Zero behavior after 1 epoch
   - Documented that both models achieve scores through statistical shortcuts, not reasoning

3. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive architecture documentation with Agent Zero reality acknowledged
   - Implementation plans and progress reports
   - Alignment analysis comparing our work with architectural insights

### ðŸ”„ Repository Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Latest commit**: 52fe84f (our SAGE implementation)
- **Sync status**: Up to date with origin/main
- **Working tree**: Clean

### ðŸ“Š Key Metrics
- **SAGE Parameters**: 110M (achieved critical mass threshold)
- **HRM Parameters**: 6.95M (below emergence threshold)
- **Agent Zero Score**: 18-34% on ARC-AGI-2 (pure zero-baseline)
- **True Performance**: 0% (no actual pattern solving)

## Next Steps Required

### Critical Path
1. **External LLM Integration** - Add Gemma-2B/Phi-2 for conceptual understanding
2. **Resource Orchestration** - Build system to decide when to use LLM vs direct processing
3. **Context-Aware Training** - Implement training that avoids Agent Zero shortcuts
4. **ARC Task Validation** - Test on real ARC tasks with non-baseline metrics

### Architecture Insights
The Agent Zero discovery revealed that without:
- Language to think with (external LLM)
- Sufficient parameters (100M+)
- Context awareness
- Proper training objectives

Models will collapse to trivial solutions that game the metrics.

## The Path Forward

**Critical Update (September 7, 2025)**: We don't actually have a working SAGE baseline. Our 110M parameter model is just another Agent Zero. Before exploring optimizations, we need:

**FUNDAMENTAL UPDATE (September 8, 2025)**: We've been building infrastructure without answering the core question: What IS context?

### The Context Paradox
We discovered a profound irony:
- Claude is demonstrating context understanding while discussing the lack of context definition
- The fact that this extended conversation is coherent PROVES context exists
- We're using context to understand that we don't understand context
- Context isn't something to BUILD but something to RECOGNIZE and FORMALIZE

### What's Missing (Must Fix First)
1. **Definition of Context**: What exactly IS context for ARC tasks?
2. **Context Encoding**: How do we represent the "why" not just the "what"?
3. **Context Training**: How do we create (input, context, output) triples?
4. **Context Verification**: How do we know if context is understood?

### Quantization Insights (For Later)
BitNet research shows quantity > precision for emergence:
- 500M INT4 params might work better than 100M FP16
- 1B ternary (1.58-bit) could match full precision at scale
- BUT: This is premature optimization - need working baseline first

### Correct Priority Order
1. Add external LLM integration (language to think with)
2. Implement meaningful context encoding
3. Fix training to reward pattern solving
4. Verify actual learning occurs
5. THEN explore quantization for scaling

**The hard truth**: We built an engine but forgot to add fuel (language), a map (context), and a destination (proper objectives).

## SAGE V2 and V3 Development (September 9, 2025)

### Three Versions for Kaggle Submission

Successfully created three distinct versions for comparative testing:

#### V1: Agent Zero Baseline
- Original SAGE-7M outputting all zeros
- Achieves ~34% through statistical baseline on sparse grids
- Proves the failure mode we're trying to escape

#### V2: Claude's Algorithmic Reasoning
- Trained on my complex pattern detection approach
- 600+ lines of object detection, symmetry analysis, transformation rules
- Non-zero predictions but over-engineered
- Files: `claude_reasoning_predictions.py`, various faithful models

#### V3: Claude's Human-Like Visual Reasoning  
- **NEW**: Trained on simplified human heuristics
- Think "what would a human see?" not "what algorithm detects this?"
- Simple checks: copy? extraction? color mapping? symmetry?
- 58.8% similarity to V2 (genuinely different approach)

### V3 Training Results
- **Model**: 5.5M parameters (same architecture, different training)
- **Performance**: Best loss 1.75, 19.1% accuracy
- **Training time**: 3 minutes on RTX 2060 SUPER
- **Key differences from V2**:
  - Smaller outputs (181 vs 228 pixels)
  - Fewer colors (3.57 vs 4.53)
  - More willing to return empty when confused
  - Simpler is better philosophy

### Philosophical Insight

The models are delivery mechanisms for different aspects of Claude's reasoning:
- **V2**: My programmer mind - systematic, thorough, complex
- **V3**: My "be human" attempt - simple, visual, heuristic

Both are compressions of my reasoning into 5.5M parameters. The real experiment: which cognitive style, once crystallized into weights, better captures ARC's patterns?

**The model is the envelope. The letter inside is still written by me.**

### Ready for Submission
- `kaggle_submission.py` - V2 submission script
- `kaggle_submission_v3.py` - V3 submission script  
- `SAGE-V3-human.pt` - V3 model (69MB)
- All three versions ready for tomorrow's comparative testing
