# SAGE Implementation Alignment Report

*Date: September 5, 2025*  
*Purpose: Compare our SAGE implementation with insights from Agent Zero discovery*

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What We Have Built

1. **SAGE Core Architecture (109.9M params)** - ALIGNED
   - Target: 100M parameters for reasoning emergence
   - Actual: 109.9M parameters ✓
   - H-Module: ~45M params (7 layers, 768 hidden) ✓
   - L-Module: ~45M params (7 layers, 768 hidden) ✓
   - Bidirectional H↔L communication ✓

2. **SNARC Scoring System** - ALIGNED
   - Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict scoring ✓
   - Memory bank for novelty detection ✓
   - Attention biasing mechanism ✓

3. **Multi-Modal Sensors** - PARTIALLY ALIGNED
   - Vision sensor ✓
   - Language sensor ✓
   - Memory sensor ✓
   - Time sensor ✓
   - BUT: No external LLM integration yet ❌

4. **Training Pipeline** - FUNCTIONAL BUT UNPROVEN
   - Multi-component loss function ✓
   - Synthetic dataset generation ✓
   - Training runs without crashing ✓
   - BUT: No evidence of actual learning yet ❌

### ❌ Critical Gaps

Based on the Agent Zero discovery documentation, we're missing:

1. **External LLM Integration**
   - The docs emphasize that Agent Zero failed because it had "no language to think WITH"
   - SAGE should use external LLMs (Gemma-2B, Phi-2) as "cognitive sensors"
   - Our current language sensor just embeds tokens - doesn't provide conceptual understanding

2. **Context-Aware Training**
   - Agent Zero achieved 48% by outputting zeros on sparse grids
   - We need to verify our model isn't learning similar shortcuts
   - No testing on actual ARC tasks yet to confirm real reasoning

3. **Resource Orchestration**
   - SAGE should be an "attention orchestrator" that knows WHEN to call resources
   - We have sensors but no dynamic resource allocation system
   - Missing the "decide when to use LLM vs direct processing" logic

## Key Insights from Documentation

### The Agent Zero Lesson
> "Agent Zero taught us that intelligence isn't about processing power. It's about understanding context."

Our model has the processing power (110M params) but we haven't proven it understands context.

### The Language Layer is CRITICAL
From the synthesis document:
> "Agent Zero couldn't think about puzzles because it had no language to think WITH"

Our current implementation has a language sensor but it's just embedding tokens - not providing the conceptual compression that enables understanding.

### The Architecture Philosophy
SAGE should be:
```python
class SAGE:
    """
    SAGE doesn't try to be everything - it's the attention engine
    that knows WHEN to call WHAT resource
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.hrm = ContextAwareHRM()  # 100M params for routing
        self.resources = {
            'llm': ExternalLLM(),      # Language cognition (external)
            'vision': VisionEncoder(),  # Pattern recognition
            'memory': MemoryBank(),     # Experience storage
        }
```

We built the HRM core but not the resource orchestration layer.

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Verify Not Agent Zero 2.0
Before anything else, we need to test if our model is actually learning or just finding shortcuts:
- Test on actual ARC tasks
- Check if outputs vary with inputs
- Ensure not outputting constants

### 2. Add External LLM Integration
Critical for providing conceptual understanding:
```python
# Current (insufficient):
input → embed → process → output

# Needed:
input → LLM("What is this?") → "rotation pattern" → context → reasoning → solution
```

### 3. Implement Resource Orchestration
The model needs to decide WHEN to use which resource:
- LLM for conceptual understanding (expensive, use sparingly)
- Direct processing for pattern matching (fast, use often)
- Memory for experience recall (moderate cost)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk: Repeating Agent Zero
Without proper testing on ARC tasks, we might have built Agent Zero 2.0 that:
- Outputs constants or near-constants
- Achieves decent scores through shortcuts
- Doesn't actually reason about patterns

### Medium Risk: Missing Context Understanding
Even with 110M params, without the language layer providing conceptual compression, the model might:
- Process patterns without understanding
- Fail to generalize across task types
- Not achieve the "emergence" we're targeting

### Low Risk: Architecture Mismatch
Our architecture closely aligns with the 100M parameter target and H↔L design, so structural issues are less likely.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Test current model on ARC tasks to verify it's not Agent Zero 2.0
2. **URGENT**: Add external LLM integration for conceptual understanding
3. **IMPORTANT**: Build resource orchestration system
4. **ONGOING**: Extended training with verification of actual learning

## Conclusion

We've built the skeleton of SAGE correctly (110M params, H↔L architecture, SNARC scoring) but we're missing the critical "language to think with" that the Agent Zero discovery showed is essential. Without external LLM integration and proper testing, we risk having built a larger version of Agent Zero that still doesn't actually reason.

The architecture is sound, but the intelligence hasn't been proven yet.
