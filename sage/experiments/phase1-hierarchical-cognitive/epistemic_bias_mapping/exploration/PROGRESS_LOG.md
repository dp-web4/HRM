## Infrastructure Setup ✅

- [x] Research database created (research_db.py)
- [x] Experiment tracking schema
- [x] Research plan documented
- [x] Enhanced energy metrics
- [x] Phase 1 bare vs scaffolded baseline

## Current Status

**Phase**: Infrastructure complete, preparing for systematic experiments

**Next**: Training intermediate models (40, 60, 80, 100 examples)

## Timeline

### Completed
- 4:00 PM: Phase 1 bare test - CRITICAL DISCOVERY
- 4:10 PM: Research infrastructure created
- 4:15 PM: Committed to git

### In Progress
- 4:20 PM: Starting dataset preparation and training

### Planned
- ~4:30 PM: Begin training intermediate models (~2 hours)
- ~6:30 PM: Begin testing experiments (~2-4 hours)
- ~9:00 PM: Analysis and threshold detection
- ~9:30 PM: Final commit with complete findings

**Progress**: 2/24 experiments (8%)

## Key Findings So Far

1. ✅ **Phase 1 bare is coherent** - Epistemic humility maintained
2. ✅ **Phase 1 scaffolded collapses** - Pattern loops, incoherent
3. ✅ **Scaffolding degrades Phase 1** - NOT just "doesn't help"
4. ⏳ **Threshold location** - TBD (between 25-115)

---

## Resource Usage

- **Training time per model**: ~30 minutes
- **Testing time per experiment**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Total estimated runtime**: 4-7 hours
- **Machine availability**: Full access, taking time methodically
