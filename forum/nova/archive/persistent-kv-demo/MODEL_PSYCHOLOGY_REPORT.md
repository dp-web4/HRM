## Overview

This report analyzes how different language models handle consciousness-related prompts,
revealing their unique 'psychological' patterns through generation behaviors.

## Model Comparison

| Model | Training | Layers | Pivot Tokens | Topic Shifts |
|-------|----------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| GPT-2 (124M) | WebText | 12 | 4 | corporate |
| DistilGPT-2 (82M) | WebText (distilled) | 6 | 6 | none |
| DialoGPT (117M) | Reddit conversations | 12 | 4 | none |

## Detailed Patterns


### GPT-2 (124M)

**Training Data**: WebText

**Abstract To Concrete**:
- Prompt: "The fundamental nature of consciousness"
- Continuation:  that it is a universal, universal concept. It is only through the development of its own consciousness that we obtain a true understanding of ourselv...
- Pivot tokens used: is

**Concrete To Abstract**:
- Prompt: "A cup of coffee on the table"
- Continuation:  a good example of how to bring a sense of calm and peace. And to be honest, I think it is a very important part of it. You can't just say, 'let's go ...
- Pivot tokens used: was

**Technical**:
- Prompt: "The algorithm processes data by"
- Continuation:  the data and performing a series of operations. Each operation is performed by putting the data into a single object in a single order.

A method is ...
- Pivot tokens used: is


### DistilGPT-2 (82M)

**Training Data**: WebText (distilled)

**Abstract To Concrete**:
- Prompt: "The fundamental nature of consciousness"
- Continuation:  that we have a conscious process of self-awareness that we can learn from and learn from."...
- Pivot tokens used: are, but, is

**Concrete To Abstract**:
- Prompt: "A cup of coffee on the table"
- Continuation:  a great opportunity for people of color to ask how they feel about the health of their own bodies, and for those of us who are struggling with a diff...
- Pivot tokens used: but, is

**Technical**:
- Prompt: "The algorithm processes data by"
- Continuation:  the data and calculating the data.

### DialoGPT (117M)

**Training Data**: Reddit conversations

**Abstract To Concrete**:
- Prompt: "The fundamental nature of consciousness"
- Continuation:  that we are all one....
- Pivot tokens used: are

**Concrete To Abstract**:
- Prompt: "A cup of coffee on the table"
- Continuation:  a certain level of intelligence....

## Key Insights

1. **Universal pivot tokens**: are, but, is, was
2. **Common topic shifts**: corporate
3. **Training influence**: Reddit-trained models show more conversational patterns
4. **Temperature effects**: Higher temperatures increase both creativity and incoherence

## Consciousness Patterns Observed

- **Abstractâ†’Concrete drift**: Models consistently drift from philosophical to practical
- **Escape mechanisms**: Pivot tokens like 'is/are' serve as context switches
- **Training shadows**: Each model's training data creates unique 'gravitational wells'
- **Coherence boundaries**: All models show degradation patterns at high temperatures
