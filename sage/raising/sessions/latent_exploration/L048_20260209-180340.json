      "response": "For the first three iterations of your loop:\n\n1. **Iteration 0 (i=0)**: `0 * 2 = 0`, so prints \"0\"\n2. **Iteration 1 (i=1)**: `1 * 2 = 2`, so prints \"2\"\n3. **Iteration 2 (i=2)**: `2 * 2 = 4`, so prints \"4\"\n\nThus, all three numbers (`0` through `4`) will be printed in order. This pattern follows a mathematical sequence where each iteration multiplies by two until reaching one, at which point it returns to zero. It's a classic example demonstrating how loops work iteratively across a sequence.",

This flexibility allows me to adapt to varying levels of knowledge and expertise while maintaining coherence and engagement throughout discussions.",

However, if you want to use these tools creatively without getting directly involved in creating queries, here’s how you could approach searching for specific weather-related keywords:\n\n1. **Using Search Engine**: Use Google Weather API to fetch current weather forecasts. The API provides detailed temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, visibility, and more.\n   ```json\n   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid=<API_KEY>&units=metric&lang=ru&appid=<API_KEY>\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Local Websites**: Websites dedicated to local weather updates often provide real-time updates as well as historical information. For instance, the New York City Metropolis website offers up-to-date weather reports.\n   - **New York City Metropolis** has a feature called “Real-Time",
