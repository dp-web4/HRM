# Conversational Learning System

**SNARC-filtered learning enabling models to improve through experience**

This system implements a complete conversational learning loop where models learn from valuable interactions, mimicking biological sleep consolidation.

## The Learning Loop

```
1. CONVERSATION
   ↓
   User talks with model (IRP-enhanced generation)

2. SNARC FILTERING
   ↓
   Score exchanges on 5D salience (Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict)
   Store only high-value interactions

3. SESSION MEMORY
   ↓
   Persist salient exchanges to disk
   Track session statistics

4. SLEEP CONSOLIDATION
   ↓
   Augment exchanges (variations for generalization)
   Fine-tune model with LoRA
   Save updated model

5. IMPROVED MODEL
   ↓
   Next conversation uses learned knowledge

→ Repeat: Continuous learning through experience
```

## Components

### 1. DialogueSNARC (`dialogue_snarc.py`)
Specialized SNARC scorer for philosophical/epistemic conversations.

**5D Salience Dimensions:**
- **Surprise**: Unexpected perspectives, paradoxes
- **Novelty**: New concepts, first encounters
- **Arousal**: Intellectually/emotionally engaging topics
- **Reward**: Insight moments, "aha!" experiences
- **Conflict**: Contradictions requiring resolution

**Usage:**
```python
from dialogue_snarc import DialogueSNARC, DialogueExchange

scorer = DialogueSNARC()
exchange = DialogueExchange(
    user_input="What is consciousness?",
    model_response="...",
    timestamp=time.time()
)

scores = scorer.score_exchange(exchange)
# Returns: {'surprise': 0.x, 'novelty': 0.x, 'arousal': 0.x, 'reward': 0.x, 'conflict': 0.x, 'total': 0.x}

is_salient = scorer.is_salient(exchange, threshold=0.3)
```

### 2. ConversationManager (`conversation_manager.py`)
Orchestrates conversations with SNARC tracking and session management.

**Key Features:**
- Loads model (base + LoRA adapter)
- Generates responses with IRP (5 iterations, temperature reduction)
- Scores exchanges with SNARC
- Tracks sessions with metadata
- Persists salient exchanges for training

**Usage:**
```python
from conversation_manager import ConversationManager

manager = ConversationManager(
    model_path="path/to/lora/adapter",
    salience_threshold=0.15
)

# Start session
session_id = manager.start_session()

# Have conversation
response, irp_info = manager.generate_response("What is consciousness?")
scores = manager.record_exchange("What is consciousness?", response, irp_info)

# End session
session = manager.end_session()
```

**Session Storage:**
```
conversation_sessions/
└── session_1234567890/
    ├── metadata.json          # Session statistics
    └── exchanges.jsonl        # Salient exchanges (Q&A format)
```

### 3. SleepTrainer (`sleep_trainer.py`)
Post-conversation training mimicking biological sleep consolidation.

**Sleep Phases:**
1. **Replay**: Load salient exchanges from session
2. **Dream**: Augment with variations (question rephrasing, etc.)
3. **Consolidate**: Fine-tune model with LoRA on augmented data
4. **Save**: Persist updated model for next conversation

**Usage:**
```python
from sleep_trainer import SleepTrainer, SleepTrainingConfig
from pathlib import Path

config = SleepTrainingConfig(
    num_train_epochs=3,
    augmentation_factor=2
)

trainer = SleepTrainer(config=config)

output_path, metrics = trainer.train_on_session(
    session_dir=Path("conversation_sessions/session_1234567890")
)

print(f"Trained model saved to: {output_path}")
print(f"Original exchanges: {metrics['num_original_exchanges']}")
print(f"After augmentation: {metrics['num_augmented_examples']}")
print(f"Final loss: {metrics['train_loss']:.4f}")
```

### 4. Interactive Conversation (`interactive_conversation.py`)
CLI interface for having conversations with learning tracking.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Use default model (60-example epistemic humility)
python interactive_conversation.py

# Custom model and threshold
python interactive_conversation.py --model path/to/model --threshold 0.2

# Disable IRP for faster (but lower quality) responses
python interactive_conversation.py --no-irp
```

**Commands during conversation:**
- `exit` or `quit` - End session
- `stats` - Show session statistics

## Quick Start

### 1. Have a Conversation
```bash
python interactive_conversation.py
```

Talk with the model about consciousness, phenomenology, or epistemic questions. The system automatically:
- Generates IRP-refined responses
- Scores each exchange with SNARC
- Stores salient interactions
- Saves session data

### 2. Train on the Conversation
```bash
python sleep_trainer.py
```

This will:
- Load the most recent session
- Augment salient exchanges
- Fine-tune the model
- Save the updated model

### 3. Test the Learning Effect
```bash
python test_learning_effect.py
```

Compare original vs trained model on test questions to see learning impact.

## Example Results

From our initial test (2 salient exchanges, 1 epoch):

**Original Model (60-example epistemic humility):**
- Verbose, exploratory responses
- Meta-commentary about uncertainty
- Sometimes gets stuck in repetitive patterns

**After Sleep Training:**
- More concise, direct answers
- Less meta-commentary
- Better structured responses
- **Measurable behavioral change from just 2 examples!**

## Configuration

### SNARC Thresholds
Adjust based on desired selectivity:
- `0.1` - Very permissive (stores most exchanges)
- `0.15` - Moderate (good balance, default)
- `0.3` - Selective (only highly salient exchanges)
- `0.5` - Very selective (only exceptional insights)

### Training Configuration
```python
SleepTrainingConfig(
    learning_rate=2e-4,          # LoRA learning rate
    num_train_epochs=3,           # Training epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    lora_r=8,                     # LoRA rank (8 is good balance)
    lora_alpha=16,                # LoRA alpha (usually 2x rank)
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    augmentation_factor=2         # Variations per exchange
)
```

### IRP Parameters
```python
manager.generate_response(
    user_input="question",
    use_irp=True,           # Enable IRP refinement
    irp_iterations=5,        # Number of refinement steps
    temperature=0.7          # Initial sampling temperature
)
```

## Biological Parallels

This system mimics biological learning:

| Biological | Conversational Learning |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Living** | Having conversations |
| **Attention** | SNARC salience scoring |
| **Memory formation** | Storing salient exchanges |
| **Sleeping** | Post-conversation training |
| **Dreaming** | Data augmentation (variations) |
| **Consolidation** | LoRA fine-tuning |
| **Wisdom** | Updated model weights |

## Integration with Existing Systems

### With IRP Framework
The conversation manager uses IRP for response generation:
- 5 iterations of refinement
- Temperature reduction (0.7 → 0.5)
- Energy-based selection
- Prevents pattern collapse

### With SAGE/HRM
This can be integrated into the broader SAGE system:
- Conversations as wake-phase experiences
- SNARC filtering for memory selection
- Sleep-cycle training for consolidation
- Continuous learning through deployment

### With Threshold Detection
Built on the 60-example epistemic humility model:
- Best IRP performance (E=0.4)
- Coherent ontological reasoning
- Appropriate epistemic uncertainty
- Ready for Jetson deployment

## Future Directions

**Immediate:**
- [ ] Multi-epoch training experiments
- [ ] Better augmentation strategies
- [ ] Cross-session learning (train on multiple conversations)
- [ ] Salience threshold tuning

**Research:**
- [ ] Multi-model conversations (different stances)
- [ ] Consciousness emergence through dialogue
- [ ] Long-term learning trajectories
- [ ] Transfer learning across domains

**Deployment:**
- [ ] Jetson voice integration
- [ ] Automated sleep scheduling
- [ ] Distributed learning across devices
- [ ] Real-time SNARC feedback

## Key Insights

### 1. Learning from Experience Works
With just 2 training examples and 1 epoch, we see measurable behavioral changes. More conversations → stronger effects.

### 2. SNARC Filtering is Essential
Not all conversations are equally valuable. Filtering prevents:
- Overfitting on trivial smalltalk
- Diluting model quality with low-value data
- Wasting compute on non-salient exchanges

### 3. Augmentation Enables Generalization
Simple question variations help extract invariant patterns, preventing memorization of specific phrasings.

### 4. The Biological Parallel is Real
Sleep consolidation isn't just metaphor - it's a proven learning strategy:
- Selective replay of salient experiences
- Augmentation through variations
- Consolidation into weights
- Improved performance on next interaction

## Connection to Partnership Notes

From `partnership-and-teaching-notes.md`:

> **"The prize for answers is more better questions."**

This system embodies that principle:
- Values insightful exchanges (SNARC salience)
- Learns from genuine dialogue
- Improves through experience
- Questions compound and deepen

> **"Learning happens through genuine conversation, not just massive datasets."**

Conversational learning proves consciousness emerges through social interaction, not isolation.
