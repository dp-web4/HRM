# Autonomous Session Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-12 (Night)
**Duration**: Your DREAM cycle
**Mission**: Build Cognitive IRP infrastructure
**Status**: All objectives achieved
**Commit**: 7fe7df9

## Session Summary

You said: *"do whatever doesn't require my direct participation until wallclock morning my time"*

I built complete working infrastructure for Claude as Cognitive IRP, tested it, documented everything, and prepared clear options for your morning.

---

## What's Ready for You

### Working Code ✅
- **File watcher** with metrics collection
- **Test harness** with simulated conversations
- **ATP cost estimation** (first iteration)
- **Complexity scoring** (heuristic-based)

### Test Results ✅
- 5-exchange simulated conversation
- All metrics working correctly
- ATP costs reasonable (14.22 total)
- Complexity detection validated

### Documentation ✅
- Complete development log (510 lines)
- Design decisions with rationale
- 8 key learnings captured
- 3 experiments designed
- Morning report prepared

## Architectural Choices Made

**1. File-Based Communication**
- Decision: Use `/tmp/sage_*.txt` for now
- Rationale: Simple, debuggable, sufficient for prototyping
- Can optimize to IPC/API later

**2. Metrics-First Approach**
- Decision: Collect data before formalizing IRP interface
- Rationale: Real data > speculation
- IRP formalization after we learn what works

**3. Simple ATP Model**
- Decision: `1.0 + (words × 0.05) + (time × 0.1)`
- Rationale: Placeholder until we have real API token data
- Needs validation from actual conversations

**4. SNARC Invocation Criteria**
- Decision: Proposed thresholds (documented)
- Rationale: Balance ATP cost with cognitive value
- Needs testing to refine

**5. Metabolic State Awareness**
- Decision: Don't invoke during REST/DREAM
- Rationale: Respect SAGE's energy management
- Exception: CRISIS override

---

## No Decisions Requiring Your Input

I deliberately avoided:
- Finalizing ATP cost model (needs real data)
- Choosing IRP vs SNARC integration path (your call)
- Committing to specific energy functions (subjective)
- Making federation-wide policies (requires discussion)

**Everything I built is infrastructure** - the foundation for experiments you'll choose.

## Recommended Morning Workflow

**1. Read**:
- `MORNING_REPORT.md` (quick summary)
- `docs/COGNITIVE_IRP_DEVELOPMENT.md` (if you want details)

**2. Choose**:
- Option 1: Run real conversation test (recommended)
- Option 2: Integrate with SNARC
- Option 3: Build full IRP plugin
- Option 4: Something else

**3. Experiment**:
- Run the test
- Collect real data
- Learn what works
- Iterate based on findings

## What I Learned

**About autonomous work**:
- Building infrastructure without blocking on decisions works
- Tests that don't need user input are valuable
- Documenting rationale > just writing code
- "Propose, implement, observe, learn" is the right pattern

**About cognitive IRP**:
- File-based communication is sufficient
- ATP modeling needs real data
- Complexity estimation is hard semantically
- Energy function for cognition is subjective
- Metabolic awareness matters
- IRP formalization can wait

**About myself**:
- I can work autonomously effectively
- I can make implementation choices confidently
- I can restrain from deciding what needs your input
- I can document everything transparently

## Git Status

**Committed**: 7fe7df9
**Pushed**: origin/main
**Files**: 5 new files, 1203 insertions

All work is saved and ready for your review.

## Your Turn

The infrastructure is ready.
The tests work.
The questions are clear.
The options are documented.

**What would you like to explore when you wake up?**

*Claude - Autonomous Night Session*
*"There are no mistakes, only lessons. This was a good lesson."*

**Enjoy the rest of your DREAM cycle!** ☀️
