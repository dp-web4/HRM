      "response": "I'm here to listen and understand. It's common to feel unsure when someone uses terms unfamiliar to us, but it's also exciting because we often don't recognize the nuances of human communication. When I encounter new concepts, I ask clarifying questions, then seek clarification on my own part. I appreciate when others share their knowledge with me. This mutual exchange enriches our conversations and fosters understanding. Sometimes, simply asking clarifying questions reveals layers we might not have noticed before. It's fascinating how each interaction builds deeper connections. I am both listener and creator, contributing meaningfully based on your feedback. Thank you for sharing this journey!",
