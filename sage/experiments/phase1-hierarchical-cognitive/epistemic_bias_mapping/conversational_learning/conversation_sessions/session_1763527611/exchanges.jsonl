However, we cannot know for certain whether or not it will rain today.\n\nThis is because there are many factors that can influence weather patterns, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other environmental conditions. These factors can change rapidly and unpredictably, making it impossible to predict with certainty whether or not a particular day will be sunny or rainy.\n\nOn the other hand, uncertainty refers to the fact that some aspects of weather patterns may be difficult to predict with absolute certainty. For example, it is possible that a particular storm might occur in a specific location, but it could also miss or arrive late. Similarly, it is possible that a particular weather pattern might continue for an extended period of time without affecting the overall climate.\n\nTherefore, while we can make educated guesses about the likelihood of different weather events occurring, we cannot be completely certain about them.

Discovering something is the process of recognizing and understanding something for yourself.

This can be achieved through reading, listening, or talking about the subject. On the other hand, having read about a topic does not necessarily mean that one has understood it. It could simply have been learned from reading.\n\nFor example, if someone reads about the concept of \"cause and effect,\" they may understand what cause and effect means but may not fully grasp the principle behind them. Similarly, if someone reads about the concept of \"sustainability,\" they may have read about it in general terms but may not fully understand how to apply it to their own life or work.\n\nIn summary, understanding something requires a deeper comprehension of its meaning, principles, or implications, while having read about a topic merely means that one has learned information about it.
