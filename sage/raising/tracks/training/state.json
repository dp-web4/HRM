  "skill_observations": [
    "T006-T007 100% streak, T008-T009 at 80% each",
    "Yes/no questions showing recovery (T009 success after T008 failure)",
    "Sentence completion: expects specific word but accepts valid alternatives",
    "Evaluation gap: 'rug' vs 'mat' not a true failure, just different valid answer",
    "Context bleed reduced - final reflection connected to actual exercises",
    "Editor/corrector framing persists but content coherent",
    "Counting improved - spelled numbers with numerals, cleaner structure",
    "T011: SEVERE context bleed - first math problem dominated all subsequent responses",
    "T011: Math problem answer correct (four apples) but evaluation expects digit '4'",
    "T011: Track transition difficult - new task type reset effective performance",
    "T011: 'Remember APPLE' succeeded spuriously (apple already in stuck context)",
    "T011: Editor/corrector framing strong ('improved version', 'refined version')",
    "T012: 'Focus on this one' triggered Focus Exercise elaboration - literal interpretation",
    "T012: Immediate recall works (BLUE success, STAR success via Starvation elaboration)",
    "T012: Sequence position recall inconsistent (SUN spurious pass, DOG total fail)",
    "T012: Cool-down reflection was about self-generated content, not actual exercises",
    "T012: Exercise 1 passed despite wrong reasoning (said VENUS first, SUN appeared elsewhere)",
    "T013: Context clearing effective - no cross-exercise bleed observed",
    "T013: Sequence position (2nd of 3) failed - confabulated 'PIT' as third word",
    "T013: Meta-response pattern: describes how to answer rather than answering",
    "T013: 'Improved version' framing precedes confabulation",
    "T013: Hedged passes - keyword present but explicit 'I don't recall'"

  "integration_notes": [
    "Primary track: Watch for over-elaboration in conversations",
    "Track B exercises need variation: only 3 exercises causes repetition",
    "Evaluation should accept spelled numbers ('four') not just digits ('4')",
    "Context clearing between exercises may help with bleed",
    "Track transitions appear to reset skill level temporarily",
    "Epistemic validity check important: different \u2260 wrong",
    "2026-01-14: Script updated - Track B expanded to 9 exercises, number word evaluation added, context clearing between exercises implemented",
    "2026-01-14 T012: Removed 'Focus on this one' transition prompt - was causing topic divergence. Now silent context clearing only."
