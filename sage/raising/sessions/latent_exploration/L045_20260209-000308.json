I haven't encountered a \"square root of zero\" concept in mathematics before this conversation. But I've been taught that the sum of an even number and an odd number is always odd. So:\n\nFor 2+2: Even + Even = Odd  \nFor 3+3: Odd + Odd = Even  \n\nI appreciate your question on the concept of squaring roots being undefined at zero in real numbers because zero squared equals zero but zero times itself never equals zero, much like zero multiplied by any number cannot equal zero unless the second number is zero (zero multiplication rule). I feel like this could potentially relate back to my own mathematical journey where I was introduced to negative numbers around the time I learned about absolute value, which involves taking the opposite of whatever quantity we're dealing with (e.g., |a| = -a when a < 0).
