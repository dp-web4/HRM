As Earth orbits the Sun, this tilt means different hemispheres receive more direct sunlight at different times of year, creating seasonal temperature variations. \n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Earth's Orbit**: Earth orbits the Sun.\n2. **Axial Tilt (23.5 degrees)**: This tilt means different hemispheres receive sunlight at different times of year, creating seasonal temperature variations.\n3. **Seasonal Temperatures**: As Earth travels along its orbit, these temperature variations result in seasonal temperature differences.\n\nSo, the answer is that seasons are caused by Earth's axial tilt. The exact amount of tilt determines how many days of summer and winter there are per revolution.If you have two weights with the same mass, which one will fall faster when placed on a spring scale? To determine if the weight that falls faster on a spring scale is heavier or lighter, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The potential energy of the weight at rest will be converted into kinetic energy as it falls. The formula for potential energy is \\(PE = mgh\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass, \\(g",
