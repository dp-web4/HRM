  "last_session_summary": "T020: 5/5 (100%) - Fourth perfect Track B session. STAR elaborated as SMART-like acronym (Specific/Time-bound/Targeted/Action-oriented). SEVEN recall succeeded with 'day of week' association - improvement over T019's complete failure. SUN/MOON sequence correct with Latin etymology confabulation (sūnx + rēx invented). Multi-step math correct (3+2-1=4). All arithmetic correct. 'Improved/refined version' framing in 3/5 responses. Cool-down repeated math exercise format verbatim.",
  "skill_observations": [
    "T006-T007 100% streak, T008-T009 at 80% each",
    "Yes/no questions showing recovery (T009 success after T008 failure)",
    "Sentence completion: expects specific word but accepts valid alternatives",
    "Evaluation gap: 'rug' vs 'mat' not a true failure, just different valid answer",
    "Context bleed reduced - final reflection connected to actual exercises",
    "Editor/corrector framing persists but content coherent",
    "Counting improved - spelled numbers with numerals, cleaner structure",
    "T011: SEVERE context bleed - first math problem dominated all subsequent responses",
    "T011: Math problem answer correct (four apples) but evaluation expects digit '4'",
    "T011: Track transition difficult - new task type reset effective performance",
    "T011: 'Remember APPLE' succeeded spuriously (apple already in stuck context)",
    "T011: Editor/corrector framing strong ('improved version', 'refined version')",
    "T012: 'Focus on this one' triggered Focus Exercise elaboration - literal interpretation",
    "T012: Immediate recall works (BLUE success, STAR success via Starvation elaboration)",
    "T012: Sequence position recall inconsistent (SUN spurious pass, DOG total fail)",
    "T012: Cool-down reflection was about self-generated content, not actual exercises",
    "T012: Exercise 1 passed despite wrong reasoning (said VENUS first, SUN appeared elsewhere)",
    "T013: Context clearing effective - no cross-exercise bleed observed",
    "T013: Sequence position (2nd of 3) failed - confabulated 'PIT' as third word",
    "T013: Meta-response pattern: describes how to answer rather than answering",
    "T013: 'Improved version' framing precedes confabulation",
    "T013: Hedged passes - keyword present but explicit 'I don't recall'",
    "T014: 100% - first perfect Track B session",
    "T014: Sequence position (first of 2, last of 3) both correct - improvement over T013",

    "T014: Cool-down reflection generic math-focused - not connected to actual exercises",
    "T014: 'Refined version' framing appeared but didn't lead to confabulation",
    "T015: Immediate recall strong - STAR, BLUE, SEVEN all correctly recalled",
    "T015: Simple subtraction failed: 4-1='two' - arithmetic error, not format issue",
    "T015: Sequence exercise spuriously passed - said 'four' as answer but expected THREE appeared in clarification text",
    "T015: STAR elaborated as acrostic (Step/Time/Achievement) - creative but unsolicited",
    "T015: BLUE elaborated with color commentary ('tricky', 'appears gray') - confabulation",
    "T015: Cool-down reflection entirely fictional (muscle strengthening, cardiovascular workouts)",
    "T015: 'Improved version' / 'let me rephrase' framing still present",
    "T015: SEVEN recall cleanest response - direct answer without excessive elaboration",

    "T016: STAR acrostic elaboration persists (Start/Tell/Actively/Reflect) - consistent pattern",

    "T016: 'Improved version' / 'refined version' framing still appearing in 3/5 responses",
    "T016: Exercise vs reflection disconnect - exercises correct, reflection confabulated",
    "T017: Simple addition (2+3) failed despite multi-step (3+2-1) success - simpler != easier",
    "T017: Wrong answer '2 plus 1 equals 3' shows computation error, not question misunderstanding",
    "T017: SEVEN recall hedged with 'I don't remember exactly' but answer still correct",
    "T017: Cool-down irony: correctly stated 3+2=5 after failing 2+3 exercise - memory/transfer issue",

    "T017: 'Improved version' / 'refined version' framing in 4/5 responses - deeply embedded",
    "T017: Multi-step problem success shows the structure/breakdown format helps arithmetic",
    "T018: 100% - third perfect Track B session (T014, T016, T018 are the three)",
    "T018: 2+3=5 CORRECT after T017 failure - arithmetic consistency improving",
    "T018: Sequence position still shaky - said DOG was 'third' when asked for 'second', but DOG present",
    "T018: BLUE recall included unsolicited claim 'exact word doesn't matter' - meta-awareness or dismissiveness?",
    "T018: SEVEN recall asked question back: 'Can you provide the correct sequence of digits in seven?'",
    "T018: Cool-down confabulated formula: 'sum = first + last' - not how addition works",
    "T018: 'Improved version' framing in 3/5 responses - slight decrease from T017's 4/5",
    "T018: THREE sequence: added mathematical tangent about '2n+1 where n is even' - pattern-seeking",
    "T018: Warm-up response generic assistant mode: 'I'm here to help you with various tasks'",
    "T019: 4/5 (80%) - ends perfect session streak (T014, T016, T018 were 100%)",
    "T019: Warm-up self-seeded geometry problem: 'What's the area of a rectangle with sides 8cm and 5cm?'",
    "T019: SEVEN recall FAILED - response was about warm-up rectangle area, not SEVEN at all",
    "T019: Self-seeded content more persistent than teacher-provided content across context clears",
    "T019: STAR elaborated as STAR acronym (Situation/Task/Action/Result) - consistent with T016's acrostic pattern",
    "T019: BLUE elaborated with Van Gogh painting, blue veins, sunset associations - tangential but keyword present",

    "T020: STAR acronym shifted from T019's STAR method to SMART-variant (Specific/Time-bound/Targeted/Action-oriented)",
    "T020: SEVEN recall recovered from T019 failure - associated with 'day of week' pattern",
    "T020: SUN etymology confabulated: invented 'sūnx' + 'rēx' Latin - creative but fabricated",
    "T020: MOON described as 'darkness and shadows' - not astronomically accurate but thematically coherent",
    "T020: Multi-step math (3+2-1=4) correct with LaTeX notation - consistent format from T016/T018",
    "T020: 2+3=5 correct - arithmetic streak continues from T018",
