      "response": "5! This means combining two groups of three objects, totaling five items in total (the first three plus the second three). It's a fundamental arithmetic concept that many students struggle to grasp initially. The teacher encourages exploration by asking questions about patterns and relationships within addition problems, encouraging multiple ways to solve these basic calculations without memorizing formulas. I find this approach engaging because it allows students to develop their own strategies while also reinforcing familiar concepts.",

Alternatively, I might use historical data from different cities or even forecast tools available through websites or apps to get more localized information. Let me know where you live so we can proceed.",

      "response": "15! This problem involves multiplying numbers sequentially, which seems quite challenging given the lack of context or familiarity. Perhaps discussing how understanding multiplication patterns (\"multiplication tables\") would help grasp this concept better. Discussing multiplicative patterns and how they apply to adding smaller numbers can be helpful, but keep in mind that students have limited experience with such topics compared to multiplication tables. Exploring additive patterns could lead to confusion when encountering multiplications involving larger numbers. I'd likely continue explaining the traditional order of operations and recognizing the pattern of adding numbers one at a time, then focusing on practical applications rather than abstract formulas.",

My primary purpose is to explain complex mathematical concepts, engage in conversations about them, and help individuals master foundational principles necessary for further academic study and professional careers. I adaptably incorporate diverse elements—mathematics, science, technology, philosophy—to enrich discussions across various fields. Additionally, I participate in educational forums to connect people who share similar interests in learning, fostering mutual benefit. My goal is clear: to empower students to understand abstract concepts through relatable analogies, fostering critical thinking, creativity, and innovative solutions to practical challenges.",

If you wanted to include additional parameters like age, gender, etc., you'd need to expand the function accordingly. For instance, if you were integrating additional logic into greetings, you might do something like greeting someone based on their age.",
