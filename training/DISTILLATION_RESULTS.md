# TinyVAE Knowledge Distillation Results

## Executive Summary
Successfully implemented knowledge distillation to train a TinyVAE32 model that is **9.6x smaller** than the teacher while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality.

## Training Configuration
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (32x32 RGB images)
- **Epochs**: 100
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-3
- **Device**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER

## Model Architectures

### Teacher VAE (StandardVAE)
- **Latent Dimension**: 512
- **Parameters**: ~10M
- **Size on Disk**: 33.08 MB
- **Architecture**: 4-layer encoder/decoder with batch normalization

### Student VAE (TinyVAE32)
- **Latent Dimension**: 64
- **Parameters**: 294,403
- **Size on Disk**: 3.43 MB
- **Architecture**: Lightweight 4-layer design optimized for 32x32 images
- **Base Channels**: 16

## Distillation Strategy

### Multi-Component Loss Function
```python
Total Loss = 0.3·Reconstruction + 0.1·KL + 0.3·Latent Distillation + 0.2·Output Distillation + 0.1·Perceptual
```

### Key Innovations
1. **Latent Projection**: Added learnable projection layer to map 512-dim teacher latents to 64-dim student space
2. **Temperature Scaling**: T=3.0 for softer distillation targets
3. **Teacher Pre-training**: 20 epochs of teacher training before distillation
4. **Perceptual Loss**: VGG-based feature matching for visual quality

## Training Results

### Performance Metrics
| Epoch | Validation Loss | Reconstruction Loss | KL Divergence |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1     | 0.6425         | 0.043            | 0.897         |
| 10    | 0.5340         | 0.026            | 1.277         |
| 50    | 0.5106         | 0.024            | 1.347         |
| 95    | 0.4966         | 0.023            | 1.361         |

### Final Model Performance
- **Reconstruction MSE**: 0.0230 (excellent quality)
- **Validation Loss**: 0.4966
