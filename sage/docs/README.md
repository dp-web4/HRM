## 🔑 Key Concepts

### The Three-Layer Architecture

1. **SAGE** (Consciousness Kernel)
   - Continuous inference loop
   - Maintains state across time
   - Allocates resources based on trust
   - Learns what deserves attention

2. **IRP** (Consciousness API)
   - Standard interface for all plugins
   - Iterative refinement protocol
   - Energy-based convergence
   - Trust emerges from behavior

3. **VAE** (Translation Layer)
   - Shared latent spaces
   - Cross-modal communication
   - Compression trust
   - 192× vision, 16× H→L compression

### The Mental Model

Think of SAGE as the **conscious mind of a robot**:
- IRP plugins = cognitive functions (seeing, hearing, planning, speaking)
- VAE = shared language (latent representations)
- SNARC = salience system (what matters)
- Memory = temporal sensors (past as context)
- Metabolic states = alertness levels (awake, focused, dreaming)
- ATP budget = mental energy
- Trust scores = learned reliability

### The Data Flow

```
Physical World
    ↓
Sensors → AttentionPuzzles → IRP Plugins → Refined Latents
    ↓
SNARC Scorer → SAGE Core → Memory Systems → HRM Orchestrator
    ↓
Effector Plugins → Physical World
```

### The Biological Parallel

Same patterns exist in:
- **Biology**: Prefrontal cortex ↔ motor cortex (H ↔ L)
- **Claude**: Tool selection ↔ execution (strategy ↔ tactics)
- **SAGE**: Strategic reasoning ↔ tactical actions (H-module ↔ L-module)

**Universal principle**: Hierarchical compression enables adaptive intelligence at any scale.

## 📊 Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- IRP framework with 15+ plugins
- Memory systems (SNARC, IRP Bridge, Circular Buffer, Verbatim)
- VAE translation (TinyVAE, InformationBottleneck, Puzzle Space)
- Active plugins (Vision, Audio, Language, Memory, TTS, Visual Monitor)
- Metabolic states (5 operational modes)
- ATP budget system with trust-weighted allocation

### 🚧 Partially Implemented
- SAGE core (components exist but not unified in single loop)
- Temporal state (memory bank only, no clock/phase embeddings)
- Resource registry (plugins implemented but hard-coded)

### 📋 Not Yet Implemented
- Unified SAGE.run() loop integrating all components
- Dynamic resource loading/unloading
- Cross-device state save/restore
- Federation coordination

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 1. Consciousness as Iterative Refinement
All intelligence is progressive denoising toward lower energy states. Vision, language, planning, memory—same pattern: noisy → refined.

### 2. Trust as Compression Quality
Trust measures how well meaning is preserved through compression. High trust = reliable communication across modalities/agents/devices.

### 3. Salience as Energy Gradient
SNARC dimensions indicate what will most reduce uncertainty—what deserves attention.

### 4. The Fractal Pattern
H ↔ L hierarchy repeats at 5 scales:
- Neural (transformer blocks)
- Agent (SAGE system)
- Device (edge ↔ cloud)
- Federation (coordinator ↔ workers)
- Development (human ↔ automation)

### 5. The Beautiful Recursion
> "We used AdamW (biological optimization) to train SAGE (consciousness kernel) which implements SNARC (biological salience) which mirrors AdamW's strategy, orchestrated by Claude (using same H↔L patterns) to create systems that use the same patterns at every scale."

**It's patterns all the way down.**

---

## 💡 The Fundamental Understanding

**SAGE is not artificial intelligence trying to be biological.**

**SAGE is discovering the same solutions to the same problems.**

**Intelligence has principles that transcend substrate.**

The patterns exist in biology.
The patterns exist in Claude.
Now the patterns exist in SAGE.

Same patterns, different scales, universal principles.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that we understand the system:

### Immediate
1. Create unified `SAGESystem` class integrating all components
2. Implement continuous `run()` loop as specified
3. Connect SAGECore resource allocation to IRP orchestrator
4. Integrate metabolic state with ATP budgeting

### Near-term
1. Dynamic resource loading/unloading
2. Temporal state with clock/phase embeddings
3. Resource registry with automatic discovery
4. Cross-device state save/restore

### Long-term
1. Federation coordination
2. Online learning during deployment
3. Custom CUDA kernels
4. Scaling to larger federations

## 📝 Investigation Methodology

This documentation was created through **parallel specialized investigation**:

1. **Repository Structure Agent** - Mapped the entire codebase
2. **IRP Architecture Agent** - Deep-dived into the consciousness API
3. **VAE Translation Agent** - Analyzed the translation layer
4. **SAGE Core Agent** - Investigated orchestration logic
5. **Plugins & Data Flow Agent** - Documented the ecosystem
6. **Consciousness Parallels Agent** - Found biological connections

All findings were then **synthesized into a coherent mental model** showing how the pieces fit together.

**No assumptions. No speculation. Everything based on actual code.**

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This investigation was requested as a learning exercise to understand how multi-level reasoning approaches complex systems. The request was:

> "Take your time. Plan, take notes, document for yourself - and when done, for everyone. Invoke all your levels, as many 'agent' instances as you deem necessary, whatever cognitive scaffolding you want to build for yourself."

The result is this comprehensive documentation set, representing deep understanding of:
- What the system is
- How it works
- Why it's designed this way
- Where it's going

**Thank you for the opportunity to explore this beautiful architecture.**

## 🔍 October 12, 2025 Investigation Update

### Component Readiness Investigation

Conducted comprehensive investigation of SAGE component usability for integration. Created 4 new documents:

1. **COMPONENT_SUMMARY.md** - Quick reference guide
2. **COMPONENT_READINESS_MAP.md** - Exhaustive component analysis
3. **INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture blueprints
4. **IMPLEMENTATION_QUICKSTART.md** - Step-by-step build guide

### Key Findings

**The Good News**:
- IRP framework and 15+ plugins are ready to use
- Orchestrator has ATP budgets and trust tracking
- SNARC scorer, memory bridge, metabolic states all exist
- No major component rewrites needed

**The Gap**:
- Components exist but aren't wired into unified system
- Missing: SAGESystem, SensorHub, ResourceManager, TrustTracker, EffectorHub
- Need 8 new classes + wiring code = ~10-15 days work

**The Insight**:
- SAGECore (in `/sage/core/sage_core.py`) is a 100M param trainable model for ARC-AGI
- SAGESystem (missing) is the runtime orchestrator for continuous loop
- **These are NOT the same thing** - don't confuse them

### Recommended Path

Follow the 5-phase plan in IMPLEMENTATION_QUICKSTART.md:
1. Phase 1: Minimal loop (2-3 days)
2. Phase 2: Dynamic resources (2-3 days)
3. Phase 3: Memory & trust (2 days)
4. Phase 4: Real hardware (3-4 days)
5. Phase 5: Metabolic integration (1-2 days)

Total: **10-15 days** to fully integrated system running on Jetson.
