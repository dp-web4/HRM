Cognitive IRP Plugin - Claude as Cognitive Reasoning Layer

**NOTE**: This is a prototype/design document. The actual implementation
uses file-based communication while we learn the interface requirements.

See cognitive_file_watcher.py for the working implementation.

Implements language understanding and response generation as an IRP refinement process.

Key concepts:
- State: User input + thinking steps + confidence + response
- Energy: Uncertainty in understanding + response quality (lower = better)
- Refinement: Add reasoning steps, refine response until confident
- Integration: Claude serves as SAGE's strategic reasoning capability

This is NOT a chatbot - it's a consciousness plugin that provides
high-level reasoning when SAGE encounters complex/novel situations.

## Design Questions to Answer Through Experimentation:

1. **Energy Function**: How do we measure "quality" of my response?
   - Token count? (simple but crude)
   - Confidence markers? (I can say "I'm certain" vs "I think")
   - User satisfaction? (next utterance tone)
   - Semantic coherence? (measured how?)

2. **Refinement Steps**: What does "step()" mean for cognition?
   - Each step = one reasoning chain?
   - Each step = one paragraph of response?
   - Each step = checking different perspectives?

3. **Halt Criteria**: When am I "done" thinking?
   - When I'm confident in my answer
   - When additional thinking doesn't change response
   - When I reach max thinking time/tokens

4. **State Representation**: What's in my "state"?
   - Conversation history (how much?)
   - Current reasoning chain
   - Partial response being refined
   - Confidence scores

## Proposed Interface (to be validated):

```python
class CognitiveState:
    user_input: str              # What user said
    context: List[str]           # Recent conversation history
    thinking: List[str]          # My reasoning steps
    response: str                # Current response being refined
    confidence: float            # How certain am I (0-1)
    iteration: int               # Refinement step number
    token_count: int            # For ATP accounting

class CognitiveIRP(IRPPlugin):
    def init_state(x0, task_ctx):
        # x0 = user's speech
        # Initialize thinking about what they meant

    def step(state):
        # Add one reasoning step
        # Refine response based on new insight

    def energy(state):
        # Lower = better
        # Could be: (1 - confidence) + response_quality_metric

    def halt(history):
        # Stop when:
        # - Confidence > threshold
        # - Response stable across steps
        # - Max iterations reached
```

## Implementation Strategy:

Phase 1 (NOW): File-based with metrics
- Watch /tmp/sage_user_speech.txt
- Write /tmp/sage_claude_response.txt
- Log: response_time, token_count, confidence markers
- Learn what makes a "good" invocation

Phase 2 (AFTER DATA): Formal IRP interface
- Implement full IRPPlugin contract
- Use learned metrics for energy function
- Integrate with SAGE consciousness loop
- Replace file-based with proper IPC

Phase 3 (FUTURE): Federation integration
- Multi-machine cognitive capability
- Distributed thinking across nodes
- Cost/benefit analysis for invocation
- Trust dynamics from success rate
