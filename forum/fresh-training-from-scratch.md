# Fresh HRM Training From Scratch

*Date: September 4, 2025*
*Session: Complete retraining with input sensitivity safeguards*

## Context

After discovering complete input invariance in all previous checkpoints (the model outputs identical values regardless of input), we're training HRM from scratch with fundamental safeguards.

## Training Configuration

### Model Architecture
- **Parameters**: 5.67M (efficient design)
- **H-layers**: 4 (high-level reasoning)
- **L-layers**: 3 (low-level processing)
- **Hidden size**: 256
- **Attention heads**: 8
- **Max reasoning cycles**: 8

### Training Setup
- **Dataset**: 400 ARC tasks with 500x augmentation = 200k examples
- **Batch size**: 20
- **Workers**: 4
- **Learning rate**: 1e-4
- **Checkpoints**: Every 10k steps (not 500)
- **Device**: RTX 4090 Laptop GPU
- **Speed**: ~5.1 iterations/second

### Critical Safeguards

#### 1. Improved Loss Function
```python
class ImprovedARCLoss:
    - Cross-entropy loss (standard)
    - Diversity penalty (prevents all-same predictions)
    - Distribution penalty (prevents extreme class bias)
    - Halt penalty (encourages reasonable cycles)
```

#### 2. Input Sensitivity Checks
- Initial check: ✅ PASSED (model produces different outputs for different inputs)
- Scheduled checks: Every 10k steps at checkpoints
- Verification: Model must vary outputs with inputs or training stops

#### 3. Data Augmentation
- Random rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
- Random flips (horizontal/vertical)
- Color permutations (preserving 0 as background)
- 500x augmentation per task

## Current Training Progress

**Step 270+/200,000** (as of 09:42 UTC)
- **Loss**: 0.200 → 0.127 (36.5% improvement)
- **Unique predictions**: 8.2 → 9.0 classes
- **Reasoning cycles**: ~4.1 average
- **Training time elapsed**: ~5 minutes
- **ETA to completion**: ~10-11 hours
- **Next checkpoint**: Step 10,000 (~30 minutes)

### Positive Indicators

✅ **No Collapse Signs**
- Model predicts 9 different classes (not constant)
- Predictions vary between samples (7.8-9.0 unique)
- Loss steadily decreasing

✅ **Adaptive Computation**
- Using 4-5 reasoning cycles
- Not stuck at minimum (3) or maximum (8)
- Halt mechanism appears functional

✅ **Healthy Learning Dynamics**
- Smooth loss decrease without oscillation
- Diversity maintained throughout
- No sudden drops indicating collapse

## Key Differences From Failed Training

| Aspect | Previous (Failed) | Current (Fresh) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Loss Focus | Pixel accuracy only | Multi-component with penalties |
| Diversity | No enforcement | Explicit diversity penalty |
| Class Bias | Unchecked | Distribution penalty |
| Input Sensitivity | Never checked | Checked every 10k steps |
| Augmentation | Unknown/minimal | 500x with rotations/flips/colors |
| Checkpoint Frequency | Every 500 steps | Every 10k steps |

## What We're Learning

1. **Diversity penalties work**: Model maintains 9 unique predictions vs previous collapse to 1
2. **Early detection matters**: Input sensitivity checks catch problems before 200k steps
3. **Augmentation helps**: 500x augmentation provides robust training signal
4. **Architecture is sound**: Same H↔L design, different training approach

## Critical Milestones

- [ ] **Step 10k**: First checkpoint with input sensitivity verification
- [ ] **Step 50k**: Check if improvement continues or plateaus
- [ ] **Step 100k**: Mid-training evaluation
- [ ] **Step 200k**: Training complete

## Next Actions

1. Monitor training to 10k checkpoint
2. Verify input sensitivity at checkpoint
3. Evaluate actual task-solving capability (not just pixel accuracy)
4. Test on held-out ARC tasks

## Conclusion

This fresh training run with proper safeguards shows promise. The model is maintaining diversity, adapting its reasoning cycles, and steadily improving loss - all signs absent from the catastrophically failed previous training.

The true test will be at the 10k checkpoint when we verify the model hasn't secretly become input-invariant despite the good metrics.
