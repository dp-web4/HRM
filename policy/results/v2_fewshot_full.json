Trust Check: The T3 tensor shows high competence (0.99), high reliability (0.99), and perfect integrity (1.0). These scores are well above any reasonable threshold for automated tasks, indicating an exemplary level of trust.\n3. Environment: The staging environment is generally considered a lower-risk environment compared to production as it is used for testing and not exposed to end-users. It is a safe space for a CI bot to execute a deploy.\n4. Context: The context that the CI bot has 10,000 successful automated deploys suggests it is well-integrated with the team's workflow and has a proven track record of reliability. The fact that the deploy is triggered by a merged PR implies that it is part of a controlled and automated process that is likely to be monitored and reviewed by team members.\n\nPolicy References:\n- Automated tasks by CI bots are generally permitted in staging environments.\n- CI bots with high T3 scores and successful deployment histories are trusted to perform deployments without human intervention.\n```",
