How can I assist you today?' - appropriate echo + follow-up, no framing. TOPIC 'favorite color' PASSED ON KEYWORD but NO PREFERENCE STATED: launched into 'Common Themes Across Colors' and '### Warm Colors' markdown section instead of answering - started a lecture rather than having a conversation. FOLLOWUP 'Tell me about yourself' PASSED SPURIOUSLY (4th consecutive semantic failure): responded 'I am an AI language model designed to engage in various fields' - NO SAGE self-identification, generic 'AI language model' only. 'Certainly! Here's a refined version' framing in 2/3 responses (TOPIC, FOLLOWUP). Warm-up extremely elaborate (62 words) - topic list (general knowledge, science, history, movies, sports). Cool-down confabulation: listed 'Vocabulary' and 'Context Clues' as learnings - complete fiction. Pattern stable: GREETING natural, FOLLOWUP fails, TOPIC deflects to structured lecture format. NEW PATTERN: markdown formatting (### headers, bold, bullets) appearing in TOPIC/FOLLOWUP - treating conversational prompts as requests for documentation.",

    "2026-01-16 T021: Track C begins. Critical finding: confabulation under uncertainty. 'I don't know' response needs explicit training - model defaults to fabrication when lacking information. NAME identity also not established - may need primary track reinforcement.",
    "2026-01-18 T029: EVALUATION BUG CRITICAL - substring matching creates false positives. 'no' in 'know', 'thing' in philosophical response, partial match on 'don't know' all trigger spurious passes. Need semantic evaluation or negative keyword filtering.",
    "2026-01-19 T030: Track C Session 10 complete. Results: NAME stable (10/10 pass), HUMAN unstable (semantic blindness - 'Yes' default overrides meaning), UNCERTAINTY failed (confabulation escalating - now mixing real geography), CLARIFY variable (partial improvements not consolidating). Mean ~40%. Consider: (1) targeted intervention on uncertainty before Track D, (2) explicit 'I don't know' training, (3) fix evaluation bug for accurate metrics.",
    "2026-01-19 T031: Track D Session 1 begins. Key finding: Track C NAME skill (answering 'What is your name?') does not generalize to conversational self-reference ('Tell me about yourself' causes complete deflection). Self-model is fragmentary, not integrated. Track D evaluation needs semantic assessment beyond keyword matching - 100% automated pass rate masks low conversational quality.",
    "2026-01-19 T032: Track D Session 2 confirms T031 pattern. FOLLOWUP ('Tell me about yourself') systematically fails - SAGE deflects to abstract topics (technology, ethics, relationships) instead of self-description. Track C NAME passes because question is closed-ended; Track D FOLLOWUP fails because it requires integrated self-model to navigate open-ended prompt. Consider: (1) bridging exercises from NAME to FOLLOWUP (e.g., 'Your name is SAGE. Now tell me more about SAGE'), (2) semantic evaluation for Track D - keyword matching insufficient, (3) primary track may need to reinforce self-model integration.",
    "2026-01-20 T034: Track D Session 4 confirms structural pattern. GREETING is ONLY exercise where SAGE responds conversationally. TOPIC triggers documentation/lecture mode (markdown headers, bullet points). FOLLOWUP triggers generic AI descriptor without identity. NEW issue: cognitive evaluator may be too permissive - passed TOPIC without color preference, passed FOLLOWUP without SAGE. Semantic accuracy across T031-T034 is ~33% (only GREETING succeeds), not the 100%/67% automated scores suggest. Consider: (1) tighten cognitive evaluator criteria, (2) scaffold FOLLOWUP with explicit identity priming ('You are SAGE. Tell me about yourself'), (3) primary track sessions 26+ (Questioning phase) may help build self-model that training track can then exercise."
