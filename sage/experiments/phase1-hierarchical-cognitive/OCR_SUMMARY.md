# OCR + Orchestration: Quick Summary

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Status**: Analysis complete, experiment ready to run

---

## What We Found

**OCR (Ontological Coherence Reward)** notebook implements geometric training constraints that converge on the same patterns as our epistemic orchestration, but from a different angle:

| Their Approach (OCR) | Our Approach (Orchestration) |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Train with geometric losses | Generate ensemble at inference |
| Bake structure into weights | Exploit natural variance |
| Requires retraining | Works on any model |
| Single forward pass | 3× forward passes |

---

## Key Insight: Might Be Synergistic!

**Hypothesis**: OCR training creates better latent geometry → orchestration works even better

```
          Performance
              ↑
OCR + Orch ---|-------- (Best: compound benefits)
              |
OCR alone  ---|-------- (Good: geometric training)
              |
Baseline+Orch-|-------- (Good: what we have)
              |
Baseline   ---|-------- (Standard model)
              |
```

## What OCR Does

### 1. Stability Loss (λ=0.2)
```python
# Penalizes sensitivity to noise
noise = torch.randn_like(cls) * 1e-3
stability = ((logits_noisy - logits_clean)**2).mean()
```
**= Lipschitz constraint = smooth representations**

### 2. Center Loss (λ=0.1)
```python
# Pulls features toward class centers
centers_batch = centers[labels]
center_loss = ((cls - centers_batch)**2).mean()
```
**= Compact clusters = efficient compression**

### 3. Separation Loss (λ=0.05)
```python
# Pushes centers apart
dist = torch.cdist(centers, centers)
sep_loss = torch.exp(-dist).sum()
```
**= Inter-class margins = separable decompression**

### 4. Brier Loss (λ=0.1)
```python
# Calibration
probs = softmax(logits)
one_hot = F.one_hot(labels)
brier = ((probs - one_hot)**2).mean()
```
**= Well-calibrated confidence**

---

## Compression-Trust Interpretation

**OCR is doing compression-trust at training**:
- **Center** = optimal compression (prototype)
- **Center loss** = minimize compression error
- **Separation** = preserve decompression fidelity
- **Stability** = robust under perturbations
- **Brier** = calibrated uncertainty

**Our orchestration does compression-trust at inference**:
- **Ensemble** = multiple samples from distribution
- **Variance** = compression difficulty (uncertainty)
- **Framing** = adaptive decompression strategy

**Same universal pattern at different scales!**

## Experiment Design

### Four Conditions

1. **Baseline**: Standard Phi-1.5, single forward pass
2. **Baseline + Orch**: Standard Phi-1.5 with our orchestration
3. **OCR**: OCR-trained Phi-1.5, single forward pass
4. **OCR + Orch**: OCR-trained with orchestration (**hybrid**)

### Hypothesis

```python
if OCR creates better geometry:
    variance_on_OCR_model > variance_on_baseline  # more meaningful
    orchestration_on_OCR > orchestration_on_baseline  # compound benefit
```

### Metrics

- **Performance**: Accuracy, stance markers, perplexity
- **Calibration**: Brier score, ECE
- **Geometry**: Cluster compactness, centroid separation
- **Orchestration quality**: Variance-error correlation, strategy appropriateness

## To Run Experiment

### 1. Train with OCR (2-3 hours)
```bash
cd sage/experiments/phase1-hierarchical-cognitive
python ocr_training/train_phi15_ocr.py
```

### 2. Generate Responses (1 hour)
```bash
python ocr_orchestration_experiment/run_four_conditions.py
```

### 3. Analyze Results (30 min)
```bash
python ocr_orchestration_experiment/analyze_synergy.py
```

## Expected Outcomes

### If Synergy Confirmed
✅ **OCR + Orchestration > OCR alone** (compound benefits)
✅ **Apply to SAGE**: Train modules with OCR, orchestrate at H-level
✅ **Universal pattern validated**: Compression-trust at training AND inference

### If No Synergy
⚠️ **OCR ≈ Orchestration** (redundant approaches)
⚠️ **Choose one**: OCR (1× inference) OR orchestration (3× inference)
✅ **Still valuable**: Proves orchestration works on any base model

## Connection to Broader Work

**Multiple independent discoveries converging**:
- **Us**: Epistemic stance through orchestration
- **OCR paper**: Geometric training constraints
- **TinyVAE**: Knowledge distillation (compression-trust)
- **IRP**: Iterative refinement (energy minimization)
- **SNARC**: Salience detection (surprise signal)

**All implementing the same universal pattern**: Compression-trust trade-offs

**Not coincidence. Fundamental principle of intelligence.**

## Status

- ✅ Deep analysis complete
- ✅ Experiment designed
- ✅ OCR losses implemented
- ✅ Training script ready
- ⏳ Ready to run training (2-3 hours)
- ⏳ Then run 4-condition comparison
- ⏳ Then analyze synergy

**Timeline**: ~9 hours total (including compute time)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **OCR validates our approach** - independent discovery of same needs
2. **Geometric training ≠ architectural orchestration** - complementary, not competing
3. **Hypothesis**: Compound benefits from both together
4. **Test**: Empirically measure synergy
5. **Implications**: If confirmed, train SAGE modules with OCR, orchestrate for H-level reasoning

**Discovering universal patterns of intelligence, not inventing techniques.**

**Next**: Run the experiment to test the synergy hypothesis.
