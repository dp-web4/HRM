# SAGE Development Status

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Cycle**: Post-281 (training paused for architecture refactoring)

## Current State

### Autonomous Attention System - OPERATIONAL ✅

Implemented fractal cognition routing for SAGE development monitoring:
- **L-Level**: Autonomous file/state monitoring (`monitor_sage.sh`)
- **Salience**: Multi-metric interest calculation (0.0-1.0 score)
- **Wake Signal**: Creates `/tmp/claude_wake_signal_sage.md` when threshold exceeded
- **H-Level**: Claude strategic attention on session start (`wake_up.sh`)

See `orchestration/AUTONOMOUS_ATTENTION.md` for full documentation.

### Real GR00T Integration - IN PROGRESS

Successfully transitioned from mock implementations to **real NVIDIA GR00T N1.5 3B parameter model**.

#### Completed ✅
- Downloaded actual model weights from HuggingFace (`nvidia/GR00T-N1.5-3B`)
- Loaded real 2.7B parameter GR00T model successfully
- Confirmed model components:
  - Qwen3-1.7B language backbone
  - SigLIP vision encoder
  - ResNet-50 proprioception encoder
- Set up multi-agent orchestration infrastructure with claude-flow
- Implemented core agents:
  - Trust-Attention-Surprise coordinator (tested, working)
  - Memory consolidation agent (83% compression achieved)
  - Metabolic state manager (5-state transitions working)

#### Current Issue ⚠️
- `AttributeError: 'GR00T_N1_5' object has no attribute 'process_backbone_inputs'`
- Need to investigate correct GR00T API method names
- File: `/home/dp/ai-workspace/HRM/sage/orchestration/real_groot_sage.py`

### Architecture

**Key Insight**: GR00T is the teacher, SAGE is the student. We're doing **knowledge distillation**, not preprocessing.

```
GR00T (Teacher)          SAGE (Student)
     ↓                        ↓
 Full 3B Model    →    Distilled Patterns
 Vision+Language  →    IRP Primitives
 Action Policies  →    Trust-Attn-Surprise
```

```

### Next Steps

1. **Fix GR00T API calls** - Investigate correct method names in GR00T_N1_5
2. **Feature extraction** - Get vision/language embeddings from real model
3. **Distillation pipeline** - Extract patterns from GR00T for SAGE training
4. **Integration testing** - Run full orchestration loop with real model
5. **Resume training** - Train SAGE on real GR00T features

### Lessons Learned

🚫 **No more shortcuts or mocks**
✅ **Use real implementations**
✅ **Weights ARE available on HuggingFace**
✅ **Transparency about what's real vs mocked**

### Dependencies

- GR00T repository: `/home/dp/ai-workspace/isaac-gr00t/`
- Model cache: `/home/dp/.cache/huggingface/hub`
- Orchestration: claude-flow multi-agent system

### Performance Metrics (Last Real Test)

- Trust coordinator: Balanced attention across 3 sources
- Memory consolidation: 83% compression ratio
- Metabolic states: Smooth transitions WAKE→FOCUS→REST

---

**Bottom Line**: We have the real 3B parameter GR00T model loaded and ready. Just need to fix the API calls to extract features and start distillation.
